## Cusco

Getting to Machu Picchu is a multi step process. First, you'll want to fly to the city of Cusco which is at an elevation of over 11,000 feet (3,400 m). From there we traveled to Ollantaytambo, which is both a great archeological site and a train station. That train will take you to the small town of Aguas Calientes from where you can get on the 20 minute shuttle bus to the famed city in the mountains.

Cusco is an amazing city in its own right. Nestled in the mountains, the city sprawls up into the hills. It once served as the seat of power for the Inca civilization and Inca-built walls still are visible as you walk down the streets. The first night we stayed within view of Coricancha and the Santa Domingo Church, a site that once was an Incan temple with walls covered in gold. It now has a catholic church and former convent though much of the sophisticated Incan masonry is visible. After arriving we had dinner at the "La Cusqueñita" which was a tasty introduction to the local Quechua culture. We chose the dinner buffet so we could try out multiple traditional. During dinner we were entertained by local musicians and dancers who traded off performances. It was a great introduction to the city because early the next morning we were picked up by our tour company to begin our trip through sacred valley.

When we first began researching traveling to Machu Picchu, we didn't know how much there is to see in the surrounding area called "sacred valley". But was we learned, the rest of the valley is probably more worth more than Machu Picchu, so if you want to visit the famous site, plan time to see the other nearby sites. Our tour started by driving up to Lake Puray. The lake feels a bit off the beaten path but it is a beautiful site. Our tour company brought us to a local lady's house and we paid a few bucks to enjoy the view from her back yard and drink coca tea. Coca tea is really helpful when traveling in Cusco because it is believed to help avoid altitude sickness which is a real concern for many tourists. Many hotels and restaurants have coca leaves available at tea stations, however you won't find the tea in the US because it is the same plant that is used to make cocaine.

From Puray, our tour brought us to Chinchero where a local store gave us a demonstration of how alpaca wool how local groups have traditionally cleaned and dyed the wool using native resources to make an array of colors. It was really interesting to witness. We then headed to the Chinchero archeological site where once a palace stood but now is a Spanish-built, Catholic church. While there, our guide told us about how some believe that an Incan king traveled across the Pacific ocean and visited the Easter Islands. The Chinchero site was also notable for the agricultural terraces which helped the people take advantage of the rich soil there.

From there we went to Moray, which is a site with multiple circular terraces defending nearly 100 feet (30 m) down. The bottom of the formation can be as much as 30 °F (15 °C) warmer than the bottom which some speculate allowed the Incas to grow foods that didn't naturally grow in that region. Next we headed to the Maras salt mine. This working salt mine takes salty water that flows out of the hillside and directs it into shallow basins where the water evaporates, leaving the salt behind. The sheer number of these white basins is astounding when you arrive making a dramatic site. However, the contrast between the line of tourists visiting the site and the people raking and carrying large bags of unrefined salt was an interesting blend of the realities of the local economy.

We ended our tour in Ollantaytambo. While the rest of our tour group headed back to Cusco, we had an oportunity to really explore the site as we waited for our train. We were happy to leave our guide who had really rushed through each site, especially considering the size of Ollantaytambo. At one point the site was the personal residence of the Incan emperor and was a stronghold during the Spanish conquest. The hills around the town are dominated by large agricultural terraces and storehouses. Up on one of the ridges stand 6 giant stones fit tightly together in what is referred to as the Sun Temple which is believed to have been under construction when it was abandoned. We walked around the site for several hours and while the Sun Temple was busy, much of the site was quiet, including the series of fountains and walkways to the north.

Towards the evening we were still waiting for our train so we went to a nearby coffee shop where we had a bite to eat. We tried to connect to the internet but the connection in the cafe was too spotty. As evening fell we got a ride down the street to the train station and took our two car train through the night to Aguas Calientes.

We decided to stay in Aguas Caliente the night before we went to Machu Picchu so that we could visit the site early in the morning. It is a tiny town consisting of hotels, restaurants, and shops catering to the tourists. We woke up at 4:30 AM, bought our shuttle ticket, and were able to arrive at the entrance of Machu Picchu by 6:30. As we entered we followed a short path before we arrived at some of the terraces that overlook the site. We continued around the southern section of the loop and were able to see as the first rays of sunlight hit the stone walls and the mountain above. It was more beautiful than I imagined.

Our early morning arrival really paid off. Since the park only opens at 6 AM and the number of people allowed to enter each hour is limited, we were both ablee to beat the crowds and get great views.
