After Mexico, Peru was the country we spent the most time in while traveling abroad. It is a giant country and we enjoyed getting to see different parts of it. But the best part was that we were able to stay with family and spend our weekends with them as they showed us what they loved.

Having family or friends pick you up at the airport is the best way to arrive in a new place. My cousin has lived in Peru for several years and graciously offered us a place to stay. Lima is a much larger city than Puebla and is continuing to grow. What were once separate towns are now neighborhoods with their own style. One thing we came over the course of our time in Peru is that Lima dominates the country, in politics, transportation, and culture.

My cousin helped us get settled in to their place in Lima, showing us where to get groceries and helping us get a SIM card for my phone. For about \$15 we were able to get a mobile internet plan that allowed us to stay connected through most of our trip. They also connected us with their church young adults community. Less than two weeks after arriving, we headed out on the most exciting excursion of our trip; Machu Picchu!

Since the Cusco area was an experience of it's own you can read all about that separately.
