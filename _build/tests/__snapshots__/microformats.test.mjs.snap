twice, flying through the night, flying for more than 6 hours at a time,
having periodic naps, and standing in lines for long stretches, I have stopped
keeping a close eye on time. I guess that is a fitting entrance to Africa. On
Tuesday I was counting every minute making sure I worked enough hours for the
week and rushing through getting out the door to make our plane on time. This
afternoon we didn’t have to manage ant firm times for events to happen. Our
plan was to fly directly from Brussels to Monrovia, Liberia. God apparently
had other plans. After about four hours into our “last flight” to Liberia the
pilots decided it was necessary to divert the flight to Senegal, several
countries up the west coast of Africa. We would find out later that some
unexpected bad weather had caused a crack in the windshield of the airplane
and the Dakar airport was better prepared to make the repairs.</p>

<p>We followed the mass of other displaced travelers out of the airport to where
bus after bus came to shuttle people and their luggage to our hotel. But this
long wait provided us with an opportunity to connect with the other people on
our flight to Monrovia including native Liberians and humanitarian/missions
workers. This first look at Africa was a great introduction to the differences
in culture that we may have to face. I enjoyed looking at the way people
dressed, how they interacted with each other, and how the English speaking
Liberians interacted with the primarily French speaking Senegal workers. When
our boxes finally got loaded on a bus and we packed inside, we got a small
tour of the city on the way to our hotel. I was reminded of many scenes from
Bekah and my trip to Kosovo in eastern Europe last year. Things like the
concrete buildings, the mix of businesses, and people standing around. But
there were also significant differences. Dakar Senegal had more poverty, more
English, and more social/open people than Mitrovica, Kosovo. It was great to
explore this new world.</p>

<p>Things are still up in the air for our real final flight to Liberia but for
