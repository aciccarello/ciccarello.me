## What We're Doing now

In 2024 we transferred our license to a different foster care agency we feel better aligns with our values and we can trust to provide solid support. We are currently waiting for placement. If you have any questions you can always [reach out to me directly](/#connect).

## Our Foster Care Journey

We initially started the process to become licensed resource parent license in the middle of 2020. After a series of delays, we [finally were licensed](/blog/2021/07/26/we're-becoming-foster-parents/) in San Diego California on July 20th, 2021. We had our [first foster care placement](/blog/2021/10/03/we've-started-our-first-placement/) mid September 2021 of a five-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl and they [returned](/blog/2022/01/30/wrapping-up-our-first-fostering-experience/) to live with family members 6 weeks later. In 2024 we transferred our license to a different foster care agency we feel better aligns with our values and we can trust to provide solid support.
