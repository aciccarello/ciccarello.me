## What we're doing now

We are currently working on transferring our license to a different foster care agency we feel better aligns with our values and we can trust to provide solid support. If you have any questions you can always [reach out to me directly](/#connect).

## Our Foster Care Journey

We initially started the process to become licensed resource parent license in the middle of 2020. After a series of delays, we [finally were licensed](/blog/2021/07/26/we're-becoming-foster-parents/) in San Diego California on July 20th, 2021. We had our [first foster care placement](/blog/2021/10/03/we've-started-our-first-placement/) mid September 2021 of a five-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl and they [returned](/blog/2022/01/30/wrapping-up-our-first-fostering-experience/) to live with family members 6 weeks later. For more information, check out our [foster care posts](/posts/tags/foster%20care).

## How you can help us

- Pray that we can use this transitional time to best prepare ourselves and our home for future foster kids
- Pray for wisdom as we adjust to parenthood and make decisions about who we will foster
- Pray for our future and former foster kids and their families as they work through life challenges and transitions
- Help us make our home more kid friendly with items from our [registry](https://www.babylist.com/ciccarello-foster-care)
- If you live nearby, let us know if you're able to come over to baby sit or even just play with our future foster kids
- Be patient with us and our children when we deal with hard days or are unable to attend social engagements
