It is my intention to limit unnecessary user tracking. For transparency I have described the main ways which a visitor to the site may be tracked. However, I make no guarantees that this information is comprehensive.

## Analytics

This site uses Cloudflare Web Analytics a privacy-first analytics product that doesn't track individual users over time but only checks page views. You can read more on the [Cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics/)

## Subscriber Lists

[Email subscriptions](/subscribe) are handled by MailerLite and is subject to their [privacy policy](https://www.mailerlite.com/legal/privacy-policy). I promise not to sell email addresses or use them other than to share updates. You may unsubscribe at any time using the link in the emails or by contacting me directly.
## Third-party Code

The use of third-party code is intentionally limited to only where necessary to protect people's privacy. Outside of the above analytics code, some pages include embedded content such as YouTube, Instagram, or Twitter content which likely include their own tracking code and is subject to the privacy policy of those websites.
