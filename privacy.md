It is my intention to limit unnecessary user tracking. For transparency I have described the main ways which a visitor to the site may be tracked. However, I make no guarantees that this information is comprehensive.

## Analytics

This site uses Cloudflare Web Analytics a privacy-first analytics product that doesn't track individual users over time but only checks page views. You can read more on the [Cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics/)

## Replies

My site will sometimes display content from others such as mentions/replies from others received via Webmentions or as context to one of my replies.
Replies are loaded dynamically from [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) and may log requests for debugging.
If you would like to remove your content from these parts of my site, please reach out and I'll try to update the site promptly.
If your content from the fediverse or Bluesky was bridged via Bridgy Fed, you may want to [opt out of Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#opt-out).

## Subscriber Lists

[Email subscriptions](/subscribe) are handled by Mailchimp and is subject to their [privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/). I promise not to sell email addresses or use them other than to share updates. You may unsubscribe at any time using the link in the emails or by contacting me directly.

## Third-party Resources

The use of third-party code is intentionally limited to only where necessary to protect people's privacy.
Outside of the above analytics code, some pages include embedded content (iframes or JavaScript scripts) such as YouTube, Apple Music, Google Books, Instagram, or Twitter content which likely include their own tracking code and is subject to the privacy policy of those websites.
Some pages also reference external images (e.g. avatars or reply context images) directly which may track requests.
