It is my intention to limit unnecessary user tracking. For transparency I have described the main ways which a visitor to the site may be tracked. However, I make no guarantees that this information is comprehensive.

## Analytics

This site uses Cloudflare Web Analytics a privacy-first analytics product that doesn't track individual users over time but only checks page views. You can read more on the [Cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics/)

## Third-party Code

The use of third-party code is intentionally limited to only where necessary to protect people's privacy. Outside of the above analytics code, some pages include embedded content such as YouTube or Twitter content which likely include their own tracking code and is subject to the privacy policy of those websites.
