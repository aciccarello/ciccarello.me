## Here lie my half baked ideas

These are work in progress posts.
Their content and URLs will likely change (and links break) but you can check out what's been written so far.
I was partially inspired to share these drafts in the spirit of ðŸŒ±[digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)ðŸª´.
However, I do intend to post these when they are ready.
