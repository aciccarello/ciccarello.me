## Here lie my half baked ideas

These are work in progress posts.
Their content and URLs will likely change (and links break) but you can check out what's been written so far.
I was partially inspired to share these drafts in the spirit of 🌱[digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)🪴.
However, I do intend to post these to an actual URL when they are ready.
In addition to post ideas, I also have lots of website ideas in my [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues).
