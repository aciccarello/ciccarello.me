This is a staple of the Oceanside harbor.
It is a casual counter service restaurant with several fried food options.
The decor inside leans heavily into the ocean themes.
The fried fish are pretty long so 2 fish tacos is usually plenty.
By itself it's not super flavorful so grab a lemon and some tarter sauce and/or ketchup.
I'm not a big fan of coleslaw but people recommended it.
For sides, I personally liked the sweet potato fries and beans.
