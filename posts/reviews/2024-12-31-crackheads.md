This location opened in 2024 and features a collection of restaurant order windows out of shipping containers and outdoor seating.
When I first went with a group of friends we all complained about the decision to put sand under all the picnic tables but generally the outdoor vibes are nice for Southern California.
There are a variety of options for cuisine so it's great for groups with varied taste.

## Crackheads

This is their [second location](https://www.crackheads.com/location/crackheads-oceanside/) (after [Carlsbad](https://www.crackheads.com/location/crackheads-carlsbad/)).
There's a bar area serving drinks.

## Tacos 1975

I had their <span lang="es">camarÃ³n</span> burrito and was happy with the generous size, volume of shrimp, and flavor.
Their spicy green salsa was hotter than I expected (their sauces were either spicy or mild ðŸ¤·) but I liked it as a meal.
They also have tacos, quesadillas, nachos, and <span lang="es">agua frescas</span> but I thought the drinks were too pricy.

## Thai Style Kitchen

Bekah liked their Pad Thai and Thai tea.
A friend recommended their drunken noodles.
They also have a location at the Wind Mill Food Hall in Carlsbad.

## Smash'd Burgers

A friend recommended their "The Original" burger with grilled onions!
Fries are extra but you get a decent amount.

## Sidelines

Pizza and sandwiches. Haven't tried yet.
Looks like they also might be at Wind Mill Food Hall.
