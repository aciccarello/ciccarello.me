The backlash to the NFL Bad Bunny halftime show announcement is problematic for so many reasons:

- Bad Bunny is a top artist with 3 Grammys and 9 nominations
- Bad Bunny is an avid sports fan, playing in MLB and NBA celebrity games
- Bad Bunny is a US citizen by birth because Puerto Rico is a US Territory 
- The US has always been a melting pot of cultures and languages 
- The NFL has been courting international viewers for a long time (with recent games in Ireland and Brazil)
- American cultural exports have improved our international standing and brought in money for US companies 
- The overlap of people watching the halftime show and those watching the game was never that significant to begin with
- Most people don't know the words to rap and hip-hop songs in English anyway 

It's fine if people don't like the halftime artist.
The show rarely makes everyone happy.
But to define anything Latin as "anti-American" is thinly veiled racism.
We shouldn't accept treating other Americans that way just like we should accept treating non-Americans inhumanely.
