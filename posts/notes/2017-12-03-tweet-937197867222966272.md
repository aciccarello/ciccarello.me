Open source feels to me like an ever expanding collection of contributions I'd love to make but can't justify spending personal time on. It'd be great if employers allowed time to contribute. Would be valuable for all parties. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open Source is such a strange thing. The open source work I do is clearly the most impactful work I do, but no one wants to pay me to work on it. Yet I&#39;m asked to speak about it, and the work I&#39;m actually *paid* to do no one really wants to hear about. ðŸ¤”</p>&mdash; Ben Lesh (@BenLesh) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/936300388906446848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
