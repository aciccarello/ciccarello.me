I'm really excited to be attending IWC SD for the third year in a row.
It's a fun time to discuss what you can do with personal websites.
While there are lots of technical problems discussed, I have found that solving the online social/communal problems are just as important.
Plus I think its a great group of people who attend.
Looking forward to seeing you all!
