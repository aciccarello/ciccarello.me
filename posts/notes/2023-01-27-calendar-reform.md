I'm very intrigued by the idea of a [calendar reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_reform). What would it look like if we had [13 months of 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar) days or some other arrangement like the [World Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Calendar) with fixed weekdays? Obviously switching systems would be a nightmare but I find the potential for consistency appealing. First the US needs to get on the metric system.
