<abbr title="Today I learned">TIL</abbr> that AM and PM (short for the latin <em lang="la">ante meridiem</em> and <em lang="la">post meridiem</em>) are styled lowercase with a preceding space and punctuation in most style guides "10:10 a.m." or "6 p.m." rather than uppercase.
Or if the style is upper case, small caps are recommended with no punctuation such as "10:10 ᴀᴍ" or "6 ᴘᴍ".

I always thought uppercase was the formally correct way!
Good news is that it varies enough that you can basically do whatever you like.
If I show up late, it's definitely not because someone typed "Meet at 6pm".
