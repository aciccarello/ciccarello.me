I just merged a big update to the site which adds dark mode and some other style changes.
The site now uses system fonts and doesn't include the material css library which should reduce the size of the initial page load.
The main goal was simplifying the codebase but css variables made dark mode easy enough to include.

I'm sure there are bugs so let me know if you encounter an issue.
The plan is to continue improving things and maybe work towards redesigning some elements.
