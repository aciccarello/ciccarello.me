I've really enjoyed the Wings Over Water birding festival this weekend, but one of my favorite surprises was finding the artwork of [Laurel Mundy](https://www.laurelmundy.com/).
Her artwork is so vivid and beautiful that we bought a few pieces and I added some to my [/stickers](/stickers/#Washtington) page.
I highly recommend checking out her [online store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TinyHouseBigWoods) if you want some cute nature artwork for yourself.
