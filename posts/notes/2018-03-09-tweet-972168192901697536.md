I remember hearing about power disputes between Kosovars and Serbs when I visited Kosovo in 2014. Crazy to hear that it has affected clocks across Europe. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Something mysterious has been happening to some clocks on the European continent. From Portugal to Poland, from Denmark to Turkey, some clocks have been running slow. And itâ€™s all because of a row between Serbia and Kosovo. A thread. <a href="https://t.co/WVZXUVom48">pic.twitter.com/WVZXUVom48</a></p>&mdash; ðŸŒ±John HyphenðŸš² (@JohnHyphen) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHyphen/status/971402820091105282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 7, 2018</a></blockquote>
