        The refs were terrible as was evidenced by the brawl at the end of the game. Slow to call fouls and give cards. Odd fouls at other times. Suspect calls near the #Rapids96 goal that completely changed the outcome of game.

That being said, the red card and subsequent [#Rapids96](/posts/tags/Rapids96) goal in extra minutes made for an exciting end.
