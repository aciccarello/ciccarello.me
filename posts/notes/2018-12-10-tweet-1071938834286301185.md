I know users on <a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TMobile</a> have been able to use WIFI calling. The option to enable appears in the settings search but it seems like the option is hidden ðŸ˜•</p>&mdash; Anthony Ciccarello (@ajciccarello) <a href="https://twitter.com/ajciccarello/status/1071893496481497088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2018</a></blockquote>
