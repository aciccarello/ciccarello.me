Today I learned the dish my family calls "egg in a hat" is called "hole in egg" by my in-laws and neither of those are the most recognized names. A [quick search online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_in_the_basket) reveals there are dozens of other names. Some were close like "egg in the basket" or "egg in the hole". Others I had never heard of like "gashouse eggs", "one-eyed Jack/Pete/Sam", and "Guy Kibbee eggs".

The dish is not to be confused with [toad in the hole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad_in_the_hole) which is an entirely different thing involving sausage.
