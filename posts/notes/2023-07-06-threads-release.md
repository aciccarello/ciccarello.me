It's interesting watching the release of Meta's new Twitter clone, [Threads](https://www.threads.net/). I've largely left the algorithmic attention traps of the major social networks but I'm (cautiously) excited about the possibility they will embrace open standards. I'd love to restore internet connections with family who's content I miss.
