Today kicks off [#BlackBirdersWeek](/posts/tags/BlackBirdersWeek) which is starting by celebrating people who are [#BlackinNature](/posts/tags/BlackinNature). This event was organized in response to the threats made against Christian Cooper while he was birding in NY. All people should feel safe to enjoy nature.
