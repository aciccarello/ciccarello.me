I've added a new lighbox feature to pages with multiple photos.
In theory it should make viewing those photos a little better by giving you a slideshow you can click through if you click on the image.
It also makes it easier to view some of smaller images in my blog posts.

It was an opportunity to use the new `<dialog>` element so hopefully the accessibility is decent.
Let me know if you have feedback on how it work.
