I think a specified [#fellowshiptime](/posts/tags/fellowshiptime)/greeting time at [#church](/posts/tags/church) is great but is often too short. Please leave enough time to go beyond shallow introductions that make people feel isolated and open up space to make visitors (and friends) feel welcomed and appreciated.
