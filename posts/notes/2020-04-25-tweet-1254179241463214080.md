        While I admire the desire to forgive and restore individuals, the christian community needs to do a better job acknowledging and protecting victims of sexual abuse, not protecting abusers.  v√≠a @Change

I'm concerned that [@DrThomasWhite](https://twitter.com/DrThomasWhite) abused his authority when he ignored the voice of the victim, hid risks from the [@cedarville](https://twitter.com/cedarville) community, and over-stated his ability to maintain accountability by hiring *and promoting* a friend who has abused his own authority.
