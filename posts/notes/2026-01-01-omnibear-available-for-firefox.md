Just in time for the IndieWeb Hackathon, you can now install Omnibear from the [Firefox Add-on store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/omnibear/)! It's also available for [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mkmdbhjfgbbdpdemimcmgmacfebjdajl) and we're working on Chrome. Please try it out if your site supports Micropub and consider contributing!
