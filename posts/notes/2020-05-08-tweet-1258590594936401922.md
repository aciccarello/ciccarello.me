How can we say America is no longer racist when
- Black men are "suspicious" simply for exercising
- White men think they have authority over Black lives
- White men can corner a Black man and murder him on video
- Law enforcement won't protect Black Americans.

It speaks to the long history of controlling, patrolling, and policing Black bodies. Look at law enforcement and the penal system.</p>&mdash; JemarTisby.Substack.com.
