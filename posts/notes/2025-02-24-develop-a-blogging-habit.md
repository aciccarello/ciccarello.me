I just got inspired to write some blog posts but I'm discouraged by the long list of previous ideas I haven't written yet. Plus I usually end up distracted by ideas for improving my site. Anyone have tips on developing a writing habit?

I mainly do it because I enjoy the feeling of capturing my thoughts and experiences for myself before they slip my memory. So I don't need to publish consistently or even have anyone read it. But I think I need a way to whittling away at my ideas. Even 20 minutes a week would something to work with if I could prioritize it.
