Today I learned that the Clippers used to be based in San Diego. Feels like something I should have known given the city's history with major sports teams and the controversy with moving without NBA approval.

Sounds like the Clippers [are coming to Oceanside](https://timesofsandiego.com/sports/2024/03/11/san-diego-clippers-are-back-nba-minor-league-team-headed-to-oceanside/)! Well, the Ontario G-league team.
