👏Congrats [@Nationals](https://twitter.com/Nationals). That was a great [#WorldSeries](/posts/tags/WorldSeries) [#Game7](/posts/tags/Game7) after an amazing postseason. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Nats went 5-0 in elimination games. They won their last 8 postseason road games. They went 4-0 on the road in the World Series against the best home team in baseball. They toppled a 106-win team and a 107-win team. Amazing.</p>&mdash; Dan Kolko (@masnKolko) <a href="https://twitter.com/masnKolko/status/1189753036454973445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2019</a></blockquote>
