ðŸŽµ listening to the album Live At Electric Lady by [Bleachers](https://www.bleachersmusic.com/)

I love the fun blend of mellow pop and elements like a jazzy saxophone.
Jack Antonoff already has been a force with his producing work with artists like Taylor Swift.
It's cool to see the different influences of people creating art.
Thanks to my sister Emily for the recommendation.
