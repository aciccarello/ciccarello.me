        I was really wanting to like Zac Efron's "Down to Earth" but it is hard to watch. I love the premise and the topics sounded great but the production severely misses the mark.

The episodes don't seem to have a point. Just two bros traveling while learning some interesting facts about unique situations. I guess they are exposing people to new ideas. But there are very few usable takeaways for such practical topics.
