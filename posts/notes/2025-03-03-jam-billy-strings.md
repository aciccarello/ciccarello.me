ðŸŽµ listening to the album Renewal by [Billy Strings](https://www.billystrings.com/)

I haven't followed contemporary bluegrass but I started listening to Billy Strings's discography after I saw they won Best Bluegrass Album at [this year's Grammy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67th_Annual_Grammy_Awards#Country_&_American_Roots).
Minus some of the trippier songs I'm really enjoying it.
There's something about the string heavy instrumentation of bluegrass that manages to really embrace the organized chaos of life.
