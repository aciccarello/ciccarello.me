        @DevinCG I find the most important thing to learn is how to water them followed by how much sunlight they need. Get an idea by looking up what that type of plant likes then adjust and see how the plant responds.

[@DevinCG](https://twitter.com/DevinCG) Also, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Sometimes a plant will stress out and lose leaves. Sometimes you'll figure it out in time for it to recover, sometimes not. You still can learn from that.
