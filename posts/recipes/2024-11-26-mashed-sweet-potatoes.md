This is a portion of the recipe in [Cailee Eats' Apple Cider Pulled Pork Recipe](https://www.caileeeats.com/recipes/apple-cider-pulled-pork-bowls-with-mashed-sweet-potatoes-maple-veggies) which I've [modified for the pressure cooker](/recipes/2024/11/26/cider-pulled-pork/).
But I've saved these mashed potatoes separately because they make a great side for other meals.
In fact, I'd recommend scaling this recipe so you have more!

1. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer ~{15%minutes} or until tender.
1. Drain the water using a colander. Let the potatoes sit a moment to get rid of extra moisture.
