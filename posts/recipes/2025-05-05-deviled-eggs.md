This is a recipe from Bekah's grandmother's recipe book that we made this Easter.
Check out the original recipe text below.

Some hard boiled egg tips to remember:

- Older eggs are easier to peel
- A teaspoon of vinegar and/or 1/2 teaspoon of salt will help keep egg whites from running out
- Don't over cook to avoid the green ring
- At high altitude, the eggs will need to sit a little longer
- To cook in a pressure cooker, use the [5-5-5 minute cook-rest-chill method](https://www.onehappyhousewife.com/instant-pot-hard-boiled-eggs/) with a steam tray and 1 cup of water

## Summary

- Prep Time: 15 minutes

1. Add @eggs{1%dozen} to a pot and cover with an inch of water and bring to a boil

1. Cool eggs in an ice bath to stop them from continuing to cook.
1. Peal eggs and slice them in two lengthwise.
1. Carefully remove the yokes and mash them in a bowl with a potato masher or a fork.

1. Repack the yolk mixture into the cooked egg white halves.

Here's the original recipe:

> Boil a dozen eggs, turning part way thru cooking a couple times so yolks are in center, hopefully! Cool and peel, slice in two the long way. Put yolks into bowl, mash with a potato masher or a fork. Add mayonnaise, about 3 tbsp. about 1 tsp. prepared mustard (of course, that will be Gulden's!), about 1/4 tsp. onion powder, salt to taste. Beat till smooth, repack into whites, trin with parsley and paprika. A dollop of sour cream with the mayo makes them light and a good consistency- nothing worse than dry yolks-use y your judgement, and keep tasting. Maybe more onion powder or salt, pepper?
