I made these for a halloween party this year and had fun with decorating.
Getting the white chocolate to pour was a little challenging but I was happy with the results.

1. Chop @Oreos{30%regular (not double stuffed)} in a food processor until fine.
1. Add @Cream cheese{1%8 oz package} and blend till evenly combined. You may want to set some cream cheese aside to be able to control the texture as needed.
1. Scoop the mixture onto a lined baking sheet into rough ball shapes and chill in the freezer for 20 minutes or fridge for at least 45 minutes.
1. Once the balls have chilled slightly, take them out and form them into the final shape. Chill again.
1. Melt @Chocolate of choice (preferably melting chocolate, not baking chocolate){2-3%cups}, adding some coconut oil if not runny enough.
1. Stick oreo balls on a skewer or toothpick and dip/drizzle with melted chocolate & decorate.
1. Chill in the refrigerator until set.
