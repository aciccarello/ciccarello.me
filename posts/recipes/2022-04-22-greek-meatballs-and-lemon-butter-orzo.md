We have really liked this recipe from [Half Baked Harvest](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/one-skillet-greek-meatballs-and-lemon-butter-orzo/) but wanted some more meat so we've adjusted the proportions.

Ingredients Note: If using fresh oregano, double the amount. Also, the ingredients list is auto-generated and doesn't merge ingredients that are used multiple times so read the whole list.

1. When the oil is hot, add the meatballs and sear until crisp and cooked through, about ~{8-10%minutes}, turning them 2-3 times. Be careful not to crowd the meatballs, so do two batches if necessary.
1. Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer them to a plate. If the pan is dirty give it a quick rinse with hot water.

1. Add the @water{2 1/2%cup} and @lemon juice lemon{1%tbsp}.
1. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook, stirring often, until al dente, about ~{7-8%minutes}. Add water if it gets too dry.
1. Stir in the @zucchini{2%shredded} and @dill{2%tbsp}. Add the meatballs back into the skillet and cook until warmed through.
1. Meanwhile, make the sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. In a bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup of the reserved sun-dried tomato oil, @lemon juice{2%tbsp}, and the @balsamic vinegar{2%tbsp} until combined. Stir in the @sun-dried tomatoes{1/2%cup chopped and oil reserved}, @dill{1%tbsp}, and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.
