Inspired by a [Pinterest Pin](https://pin.it/6F5ak4B) (original website [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216092019/http://quicklids.com/super-simple-7-layer-bean-dip/)) with a few adjustments.
This is one of our favorites for a super bowl party.

For some variations, you can add a layer of olives or serve it warmed.
We've also made this with a layer of avocado (mashed and mix with garlic salt and lime juice) which is probably best under the layer of sour cream.
