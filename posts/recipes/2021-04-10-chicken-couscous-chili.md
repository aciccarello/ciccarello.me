Inspired by [Kim's Cravings' Best Vegetarian Chili](https://www.kimscravings.com/best-ever-vegan-quinoa-chili/#wprm-recipe-container-29888) which also has instant pot and slow cooker versions. Bekah came up with the idea of adding chicken and using couscous instead of quinoa. It's great with a side of corn bread.
