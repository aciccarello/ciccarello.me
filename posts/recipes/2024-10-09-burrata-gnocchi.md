This is a recipe from [@carlo.martx](https://www.instagram.com/carlo.martx/) on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_qySOBtIVy/) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@carlo.martx/video/7412362801441672481) which was sorely lacking in details which is fine for him because he mainly looking to sell olive oil.

The original recipe called for Buffalo burrata, but we actually liked the sauce so much we would be happy to make this meal without it.
We served it with a salad and bread for dipping in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
