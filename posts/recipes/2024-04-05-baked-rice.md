This is a recipe I distinctly remember my grandmother making for us when I was a kid.
I have fond memories of consuming this comfort food and haven't encountered it outside our family.
I've made a few adjustments to my grandmother's recipe, including halving the portions, but I included the original below.
I'll highlight that this is not a quick meal but it's worth it if you have the time.
It can also be prepared a day ahead of time.
