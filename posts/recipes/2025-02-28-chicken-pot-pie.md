This was inspired by the "Brown Sage-Butter Chicken Pot Pie" from page 173 of the [Half Baked Harvest Super Simple Cookbook](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/cookbook/half-baked-harvest-super-simple/).
It's perfect to pair in a meal plan with [Rotisserie Chicken Bone Broth](/recipes/2024/01/18/rotisserie-chicken-bone-broth/) to get the richest broth flavors.
I'd also like to compare it with Tieghan's [Skillet Chicken Broccoli Pot Pie with Garlic Butter Phyllo Crust](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/skillet-chicken-broccoli-pot-pie/) recipe (probably substituting the Phyllo).

This recipe fills up my cast iron skillet close to the rim, so there may not be much room for extra carrots.
For the crust, make sure the dough is completely thawed and hasn't dried out or else it becomes hard to unfold and work with.
