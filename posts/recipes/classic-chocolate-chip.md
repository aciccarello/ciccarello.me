My brother and I made these from [Joy Food Sunshine](https://joyfoodsunshine.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-chip-cookies/) for my father's birthday party.
It ranks high in Google search results and was well received.
We were very short on baking supplies and mixed everything by hand.
They turned out great though we had to extend the baking time slightly which could have been due to the oven temperature accuracy.
We also struggled to get the chocolate chips evenly distributed in the mix so the earlier batches were a little short on chocolate.
I can also recommend using parchment paper so you can remove the cookies from the sheet before they cool.

If you are looking for a slightly richer flavor, try [Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://cookiesandcups.com/salted-brown-butter-chocolate-chip-cookies/) which starts by browning the butter.
