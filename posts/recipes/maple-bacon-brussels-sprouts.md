We were looking for a different way to prepare Brussels sprouts than [roasted](/recipes/2022/01/13/air-fried-brussels-sprouts/) and found [this one from The Pioneer Woman](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a37242804/maple-bacon-brussels-sprouts-recipe/).
We added some pine nuts we had from another recipe to add another texture.
We rarely use an entire pack of bacon when cooking breakfast, so this was a perfect way to use up what we had frozen.
I didn't even need to thaw the bacon first since it just needed to be chopped.
