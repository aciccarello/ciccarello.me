## Butterscotch Brownies

People always go nuts over these. I usually make a pan of these and a pan of chocolate if I have people in or am going to take dessert someplace. These always go first, right Paul? Incidentally, this is light but oh the joy of - and of course, I doubled your pleasure and taste.

Melt in a pan:

- 1 c. butter-use half oleo
  Stir in until dissolved:
- 2 c. light brown sugar
  Cool slightly. Beat in:
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla
  Sift together:
- 1 c. flour
- 2 tsp bak pow
- 1 tsp salt
Stir into butter mix.
Add ½ to 2 cups chopped walnuts.
Pour into well greased and lightly floured 9x13 pan. Bake 350° about 20-25 min. Cool and frost with butter cream icing, any plain white icing with butter, milk, vanilla and conf sugar. Cut into bars and serve. So good. Note: It puffs up a great mound on top when it is baking and looks weird, but that goes down when it is removed from the oven. Smells good when it is in the oven!
