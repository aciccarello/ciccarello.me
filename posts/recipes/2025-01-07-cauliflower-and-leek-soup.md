This recipe was initially based on Bethany Kramer's [Vegan Creamy Cauliflower Soup](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/creamy-cauliflower-soup-vegan/) recipe from  "A Simple Palate".
However we've added a few textures and non-vegan ingredients like sausage.
Consider doubling it if you have plenty of cauliflower.
The result should be a creamy, slightly thick soup.
This is great with fresh baked bread.

If you're in a hurry you can also throw all the ingredients in an instant pot on high for 8 minutes before blending.
It won't have quite the same flavor as sauteing but it'll be easy to throw together.
