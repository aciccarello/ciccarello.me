Bekah makes [this recipe from Ina Garten](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/lemon-curd-recipe-1941910) periodically, but usually halved and with a few minor changes.
The halved portions fit well in the Bonne Maman jelly jars we save.
It's a great with any kind of citrus.
You can add food coloring if you're using it in a cake and want it to pop, but we found it can look gimmicky by itself.
Bekah mentioned that she saw you can whip it into mousse with some heavy whipping cream so that'll be something else to try.

## Summary

- Cook Time: 10 minutes
- Yields: 1 1/2 cups

{% recipe-cooklang %}
1. Using a zester / #grater{}, remove the zest of @lemons (or other citrus){1-2}, avoiding the white pith.
1. Put the zest in a food processor, add @sugar{3/4%cup} and pulse until the zest is very finely minced into the sugar.
1. Whisk @softened, unsalted butter{2%oz} (half a stick) and beat in the sugar mixture. Allow the butter and sugar mixture to cool before the next step if hot to avoid cooking the eggs.
1. Add @eggs{2}, mixing after each, and then add @lemon juice (or other citrus){2%oz (1/4 cup)} and @salt{1/16%teaspoon}. Mix until combined.
1. Pour the mixture into a small #saucepan{} and cook over low heat until thickened (about ~{10%minutes}), stirring constantly. The lemon curd will thicken at about {% recipe-temp 170 %}, or just below simmer.
