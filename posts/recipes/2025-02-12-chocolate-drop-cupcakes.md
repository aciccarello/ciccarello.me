Bekah got a modified copy of [this cooks.com recipe](https://cooks.com/gu0wz1ru) years ago (dated 2009) from her friend Lisha's mom and recently found it.
These are rich and so don't need any frosting.
We've also made these as minis using mini chocolate chips.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 20 minutes
- Cook Time: 20 minutes (or 12 minutes per tray of minis)
- Servings: 12 cupcakes (or 36 minis)
