This recipe comes from Antoni Porowski in Queer Eye Season 9 episode 4 "[The Snack Attack is Back](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34913627/)" (around the 22 minute mark).
The name is French for "baked in parchment" and it uses the paper to seal in moisture and steam the fish.
Don't skimp on the toppings either as the fish is mild without them.
This meal is great with a salad.

The episode was a little light on details so I found [blue jean chef](https://bluejeanchef.com/recipes/halibut-en-papillote-with-lemon-and-white-wine/) had a good recipe with similar techniques.
The video shows a good way of folding the paper.
She also recommends using egg whites to hold the seal.
