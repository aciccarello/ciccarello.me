This is a recipe from Instagram advertised as a good option for meal prep.
You can adjust the amount of sriracha in the Yum Yum Sauce to control the spice level.
I halved the spice from the original recipe but when the sauce is mixed with the rice and chicken it's not too strong.
We also added broccoli.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 15-20 minutes
