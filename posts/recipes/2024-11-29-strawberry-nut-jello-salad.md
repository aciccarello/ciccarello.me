This is a Hoesterey family holiday favorite that came from my mother-in-law's cousin from Virginia.
My internet research tells me that this is a southern classic, appearing on sites like [Southern Discourse](https://southerndiscourse.com/strawberry-jello-salad/) with the subtitle "A Southern Tradition".

Don't let the term "jello salad" scare you.
This is worth a try.
