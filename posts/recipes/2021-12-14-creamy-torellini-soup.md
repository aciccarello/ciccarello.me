[This recipe from Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2019/01/30/creamy-tortellini-soup/) was made for us by someone in our foster care group during our first placement. We loved it so much we've made it again ourselves. To leave more broth, we've increased the amount of liquids from the original.
