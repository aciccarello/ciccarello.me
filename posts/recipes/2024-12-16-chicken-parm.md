I always loved having chicken Parmesan growing up, but it took me years to try to make it myself.
I often avoid breading meat, but it's actually an easy way to up the flavor and the results are totally worth it.
I based this recipe on [one by Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51451/easy-chicken-parmesan-recipe/) but with some adjustments based on tips from my mom.
These instructions say to bake on a rack to keep it crispy, but my mom will bake the chicken sitting in a pool of sauce so it's optional.
This pairs well with spaghetti and a vegetable like green beans.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 25 minutes

{% recipe-cooklang %}
1. Preheat oven to {% recipe-temp 350 %} and prep a baking sheet with a wire rack.
1. In a shallow bowl, combine @panko{1%cup}, @garlic powder{1%tsp}, and @shredded Parmesan{1%cup}.
1. Into another shallow bowl, pour @flour{3/4 cup} and add a generous amount of @salt{}, and @pepper{}.
1. In a third shallow bowl, beat @eggs{2} with @milk{1%Tbsp}.
1. In a final small bowl, mix @shredded mozzarella{1%cup} and an additional 1 cup of Parmesan cheese (optional). 
1. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound @boneless, skinless chicken cutlets (approx 1 1/2 lb){6%} till it's an even thickness of 1/2 inch thick. If the chicken breasts are especially thick, you can fillet them to make them thinner.
1. In a #large frying pan{} over medium heat, heat @vegetable oil{1%cup} until hot, aiming for {% recipe-temp 350 %}. It is okay if the oil smokes a bit. You want it hot or else the chicken won't brown properly.
1. Dip the chicken into flour, shaking off excess, then into egg, then into panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere.
1. Fry chicken until each side is golden brown, about ~{1-2%minutes} per side before transferring to prepared rack. The chicken will be under-cooked
1. When the pan is full, spoon some @marinara sauce{} over the chicken and top with the cheese mixture.
1. Bake for about ~{15%minutes} until cooked through and the cheese is melted.
