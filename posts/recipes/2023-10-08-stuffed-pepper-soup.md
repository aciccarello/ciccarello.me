We originally got this recipe from [Recipes that Crock](https://www.recipesthatcrock.com/slow-cooker-stuffed-pepper-soup/).
It can be done in a slow cooker but we like to make this in the pressure cooker.
I'd also recommend keeping some extra beef broth on hand in case you want it soupier after the rice absorbs the liquid.

A similar recipe to check out would be my [Stuffed Bell Pepper Casserole](/recipes/2022/03/14/stuffed-bell-pepper-casserole/).
