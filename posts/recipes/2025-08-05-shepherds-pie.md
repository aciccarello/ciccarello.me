This recipe was a variation on the one from [Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/easy_shepherds_pie/).
I made it in a large dutch oven and adjusted the ingredients slightly.
We were very happy with how it came out.
It's not a hard recipe but it does take some time, particularly getting all the ingredients cut and cooked before assembling.
But with a dutch oven, I only needed to use two pots.
