This is a recipe from Instagram advertised as a good option for meal prep.
You can adjust the amount of sriracha in the Yum Yum Sauce to control the spice level.
I halved the spice in the sauce from the original recipe since it packs some heat, but when the sauce is mixed with the rice and chicken it's not too strong so add sriracha to taste.
We also added broccoli to balance out the carbs and protein.
