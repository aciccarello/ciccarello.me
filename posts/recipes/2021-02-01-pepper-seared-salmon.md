![Plate with salmon, broccoli mousse, and tomato bacon jam](/assets/img/salmon-jam-broccoli-meal.jpg){.post-img--float .post-img--float-right}

This recipe is great combined with [Broccoli Mousse](/recipes/2021/02/01/broccoli-mousse/) and [Tomato Bacon Jam](/recipes/2021/02/01/tomato-bacon-jam/). After prepping the ingredients for all three recipes, start cooking the mouse, followed by the jam. When both of those are almost done, then start the salmon so it's fresh when you're ready to serve.
