This recipe is the first one we made from [The Tucci Cookbook](https://a.co/d/5LlvBKU) (page 348) which my sister got for us.
It's essentially a cheesecake but with ricotta cheese.
It took quite a bit longer to cook than anticipated and we found the foil-lined springform pan instructions a bit confusing at first.
But this was delicious with [lemon curd]() or a berry compote.

We would increase the amount of zest.
Also use a good quality vanilla (there's quite a bit).
We didn't have the rum so we used a bourbon vanilla and wanted more vanilla flavor.
