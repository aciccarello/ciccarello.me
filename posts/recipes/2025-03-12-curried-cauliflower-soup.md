This was a recipe we wrote down on a notecard.
The closest thing I could find online was [Cotter Crunch's recipe](https://www.cottercrunch.com/curried-cauliflower-rice-kale-soup-paleo/#tasty-recipes-76129) which may have been the inspiration.
That recipe calls for Kale, but we typically make this with spinach.
We didn't have a food processor so ended up modifying the recipe for an immersion blender by adding some broth to just the Cauliflower before removing and cooking the other veggies.

A related recipe to checkout is [Cauliflower and Leek Soup](/recipes/2025/01/07/cauliflower-and-leek-soup/).
