This recipe, [originally from Alexandra Cooks](https://alexandracooks.com/2018/03/02/overnight-refrigerator-focaccia-best-focaccia/) has been our go-to focaccia recipe. A pyrex glass casserole dish is perfect for a thicker bread that can be sliced for making sandwhiches. If not preparing overnight, let the mixed dough rise at room temperature for about 1.5 to 2 hours until doubled. Then reduce the second rise time to about 30 minutes.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 18 hours
- Cook Time: 20 minutes
- Servings: 8

{% recipe-ingredients %}

- 4 cups (512 g) all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 2 teaspoons (10 g) salt
- 2 teaspoons (8 g) instant yeast
- 2 cups (455 g) lukewarm water
- Virgin olive oil (extra virgin may be too strong a flavor)
- flaky sea salt
- 2 teaspoons whole rosemary leaves
- 4 cloves of minced garlic

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast before adding the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball.
1. Rub the surface of the dough lightly with olive oil (to prevent sticking to cover). Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, cloth bowl cover, or plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours or for as long as three days. (See notes above if you need to skip the overnight rise for time purposes.)
1. Grease a 9Ã—13-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray, butter, or line with parchment paper. Grease well to avoid the crust sticking to the pan. Then pour 2 tablespoons of oil in the center of the pan.
1. Using hands, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center into a rough ball. Place into the prepared pan and roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over. Let the dough ball rest for 3 to 4 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen.
1. Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to {% recipe-temp 425 %}.
1. Mix together rosemary, garlic, course salt, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small bowl. Extra time allows the rosemary to be infused in the oil.
1. When the second prove is done, pour a tablespoon of olive oil on the dough and spread it evenly on the surface before sprinkling the oil and seasoning mixture evenly.
1. Create dimples by pressing straight down using all of your fingers. If necessary, gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow the dough to fill the pan.
1. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the underside is golden and crisp.
1. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the focaccia to a cooling rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes before cutting and serving; let it cool completely if you are halving it with the intention of making a sandwich.
