Bekah family used to make this thick chili recipe.
It was passed on from her maternal grandmother.
But the trick is it has a bunch of toppings to make it more fun.
The units I've written down are half of the original which apparently made 30 servings and adjusted for current canned good sizes.

If you're looking for some variations, check out [Tara Waites's variation on Just A Pinch](https://www.justapinch.com/recipes/main-course/main-course-beef/fiesta-salad.html) which was apparently inspired by a favorite in the Texas public school cafeteria menu.
Bekah's grandmother was involved in school meals in Dallas so I wonder if Tara got it from her.
A similar (but different) recipe is, see [Cream Cheese Slow Cooker Chicken](/recipes/2021/04/30/cream-cheese-slow-cooker-chicken/) or the [soup tag](/posts/tags/soup/).
