This recipe was a variation on the one from [Family Food On the Table](https://www.familyfoodonthetable.com/slow-cooker-cream-cheese-chicken/).
We added tomatoes at the end.
I like making it in the instant pot because I can sauté and slow cook in the same dish.
We had it with bowtie pasta but it would also work with rice.
