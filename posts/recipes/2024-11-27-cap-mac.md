Adding to my list of [extra cheesy TikTok recipes](/recipes/2024/10/09/creamy-gnocchi/), this one comes from [Tini Younger](https://substack.com/home/post/p-149260496) ([TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8LeucP3/)). Or if you want to watch a more comical weed based video, check out [@mattbellassai's "Baked Baking"](https://www.tiktok.com/@mattbellassai/video/7437215514780241195).

We made this earlier this month with the [Apple Cider Pulled Pork](/recipes/2024/11/26/cider-pulled-pork/).
Honestly, this probably has too much cheese so I might tone it down.
I do recommend the Cavatappi pasta though, it's a nice touch.
