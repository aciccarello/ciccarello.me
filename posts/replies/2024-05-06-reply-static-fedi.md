    content: "Dear #indieweb, what are the good #selfhosted tools to #fediverse
      enable static sites? I've found https://fedipage.com/ but that seems tied
      to a lot of SaaS out of the box. I basically want posting of articles, and
      display of fediverse replies."

I use https://fed.brid.gy/ and webmentions to allow people to follow me from the fediverse. To send webmentions I use a netlify build plugin but you could use something like https://webmention.app/
