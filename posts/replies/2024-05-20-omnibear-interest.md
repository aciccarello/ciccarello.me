      Hey Indieweb friends...

      I've decided to let my registration of https://omnibear.com lapse

      (it's good til February).

      If anybody is interested in taking over that project,

      I'm up for a domain transfer.

      Anthony Ciccarello has indicated some interest, so teaming up with him
      might be a possibility.

Maintaining projects is hard. I'd love to see the great work Keith had done continue but know I could use help getting things working again. I'm hoping to dig into the code base soon to get a better idea of where things are at. If others want to reach out I'm available via IndieWeb chat, webmention, fediverse, and email.
