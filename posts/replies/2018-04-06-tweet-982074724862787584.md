        I had used TypeDoc in 2016, but thought it got abandoned. I looked at the repo and it appears to be active, so maybe that&#39;ll be good enough for our needs.

[@nickytonline](https://twitter.com/nickytonline) FYI, if you are looking for a feature in TypeDoc, there is a solid plugin system (though not well documented). Also, PRs are always welcome ðŸ˜‰
