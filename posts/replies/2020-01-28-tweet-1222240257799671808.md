        I have this problem. specifically, typedoc depends on an old version of typescript, but my project uses a newer version. thereâ€™s no way to force it to use _my_ version of typescript without deleting it from node_modules/typedoc/node_modules and relying on module resolution

[@b0neskull](https://twitter.com/b0neskull) [@arcanis](https://twitter.com/arcanis) [@ceejbot](https://twitter.com/ceejbot) FYI, this (TS peer-dependency) should be fixed in an upcoming release. It is already in PR.
