      I've been thinking about adding printing support for my #blog posts. So
      I'm curious about this: do you print blog posts or save them as PDFs for
      offline #reading?

I've experimented with print styles on my site. My resume is a PDF printable version of a page on my site. I also love the idea of a printed book of my website. I think there are a few (mostly defunct) services for that listed on the IndieWeb wiki somewhere.
