    content: The slash pages are only accessible through their URLs at the moment, I
      need to mull over how I want to deal with navigation in general; right now
      it's very home page centric which works for the most part, but clearly the
      scope will only keep growing…I'll sleep on it

I added a [sitemap](https://www.ciccarello.me/sitemap/) page to my site so pages would be more discoverable without needing to add everything to the homepage or footer.
