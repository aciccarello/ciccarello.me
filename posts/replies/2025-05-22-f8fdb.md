      hello!


      if you use a static site generator for your blog, like #Eleventy or
      #jekyll, AND


      if your blog has a links section,


      could you share how you’ve structured your link posts? i’m adding
      bookmarks to my website, and i think i could use a little inspiration

I'm totally going to take some inspiration from these examples. My links page is primarily a link-in-bio url but I did list the latest likes, bookmarks, and replies at the bottom. I'd like to expand that to a full page with more details.
