      Grackles stalk the street like it belongs to them. They give ground before people and cars as a matter of practicality, not respect; they go where they like, sing and defecate where they please. No gods, no masters, they say with their glittering eyes.

Aa a birder, I can totally relate to this. I think birds that are comfortable around people and that appear in large numbers are unsettling. But they are also beautiful birds. I'll never forget the time we vacationed in Costa Rica and the evening skies were filled with grackles flying to the mangroves to roost.
