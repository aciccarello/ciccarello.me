    content: Apparently birders call things on their "birds I'd love to see" list
      "lifers" and let me tell you, that does not square with what that word
      means in many, many other contexts. So I don't think I'll be calling
      things that, thanks.

I think of a "lifer" as a bird I'm just seeing for the first time. But it's so confusing that I never use it with non-birders. Would love a good alternative.
