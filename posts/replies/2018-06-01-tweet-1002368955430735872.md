        Typescript is one big migraine for me. I had a fix for an a11y issue the other day, but the setup wouldn&#39;t let me add the aria attribute because it wasn&#39;t expected. F you, Typescript, I know what I&#39;m doing.

[@heydonworks](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) [@ryanflorence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence) Assuming the HTML element types were missing an Aria property; you should let the [@typescriptlang](https://twitter.com/typescriptlang) team know what should be added to the global type definition. It would be helpful for the community.
