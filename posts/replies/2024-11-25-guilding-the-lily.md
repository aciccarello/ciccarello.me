    name: Trawling around after briefly noting Cooklang as a way of marking up
      recipes, I came across a recipe for gnocchi sauce that called for 300ml of
      cream as well as a burrata cheese and thought to myself, talk about
      gilding the lily.

ðŸ˜† The burrata really is excessive and unnecessary but it does make it memorable.
