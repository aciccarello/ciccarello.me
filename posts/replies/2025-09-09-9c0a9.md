    content: Trimming-down my social media presence, at least for now, back to just
      Micro.Blog. I love how quiet Micro.Blog is, but it does feel rather, idk,
      lonely, compared to Mastodon and BlueSky. Any tips for addressing this?

I'm using bridgy fed, but I've found hashtags get some engagement from mastodon. I also follow mastodon accounts in bridgy fed which appear in my RSS reader. Replying to mastodon accounts from my site and getting responses has felt like a good level of engagement to me.
