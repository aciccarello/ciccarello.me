      note: I like coffee. I don’t like celery. I’m an Aussie expat living in New York
        City. I know how to spell “onomatopoeia”… and I actually know what it
        means, too.
      locality: New York City
    content: Had a great time chatting with the IndieWeb crew at the Galactic Bonus
      Homebrew Website Club earlier today. Always nice to meet some new people
      and to actually talk to some of the people behind the sites I follow. Big
      thanks to James for hosting!
