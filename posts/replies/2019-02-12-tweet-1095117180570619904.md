        Ethnic groups like the Irish were more politically savvy yet they didn’t advance as a group as well as the Japanese. That’s my point. Obvious politics are necessary to maintain a government that protects property rights. This is irrespective of ethnicity

[@BigJebBos](https://twitter.com/BigJebBos) I agree that politics isn't the main driver of success and shouldn't be the only thing society focuses on.

I also believe that politics doesn't always apply property rights equally across ethnicities and we shouldn't ignore the role of politics in giving equal access to success.
