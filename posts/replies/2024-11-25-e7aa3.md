      summary: I'm a software engineer living in Southern California building cool
        things using JavaScript and other web technologies. I enjoy traveling to
        other countries and spending time in nature.
    content: Maintaining projects is hard. Iâ€™d love to see the great work Keith had
      done continue but know I could use help getting things working again. Iâ€™m
      hoping to dig into the code base soon to get a better idea of where things
      are at. If others want to reach out Iâ€™m available via IndieWeb chat,
      webmention, fediverse, and email.

Today I finally buckled down and worked on updating the Omnibear browser extension. I picked up where Keith left off on retooling. My changes broke more things than I fixed but I'm sharing publicly to give myself some accountability. Hopefully I'll be able to share an update from a working extension soon. ðŸ¤ž
