Reconciliation seeks to restore into right relationship not to destroy or devalue others.  LOVE! <a href="https://t.co/DRyHZ6GkqG">pic.twitter.com/DRyHZ6GkqG</a>

[@drxpina](https://twitter.com/drxpina) [@iamccda](https://twitter.com/iamccda) I appreciate your desire for reconciliation. However, I believe that people are raising concerns publicly because there has not been adequate action to protect ccda employees in response to privately expressed concerns.
