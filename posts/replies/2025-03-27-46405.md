      It's been a few years since I built my website using Jekyll. It's starting
      to get stale. I learned a lot about IndieWeb while setting up, so I don't
      regret using it! 


      But the overhead of the build is starting to get to me. Longing for
      something that I perceive as simpler - paid services like micro.blog or
      omg.lol - or maybe 11ty.  Not sure I can give up control to a paid service
      for my main site.

I migrated a Jekyll site to #11ty and host it on Netlify's free tier. I've been pretty happy with the flexibility.
