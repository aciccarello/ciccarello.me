Webmentions have been great to work with on my site. I haven't had much success with microsub at this point though. The Indiepass app looks really nice and has been great for posting. But my indieauth login seemed to have issues logging into the couple microsub apps I tried so probably a problem on my end. Still love the reader concept and I know a few people use it regularly.
