        @qimzu Hello there! Currently for some reason none of the Icons on my website are showing up. I&#39;ve noticed they&#39;re not showing up on <a href="https://t.co/upneR3IN2r">https://t.co/upneR3IN2r</a> either. Cheers

[@Matthewjk](https://twitter.com/Matthewjk) @qimzu I noticed the same thing but it isn't happening on Safari. I think it is due to changes in how browsers handle cookies. I'll probably host the font to avoid the issue.
