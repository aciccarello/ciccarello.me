CCDA conference goers you definitely got a glimpse into the problem. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/3RsRevisited?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#3RsRevisited</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RootedCCDA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RootedCCDA</a>

[@Tasha4gayle](https://twitter.com/Tasha4gayle) Hearing about this from a friend that was in attendance today...So sorry to hear about the experience you and others have gone through. I hope steps will be taken by leadership towards reconciliation.
