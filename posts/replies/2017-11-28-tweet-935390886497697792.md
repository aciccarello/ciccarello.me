        Dear web developers: what, in your opinion, are the top 3 problems with  the current status quo of modular JavaScript in browsers, i.e. writing modules and then transpiling+bundling? Think carefully about the *worst* problem, rank accordingly.

[@seldo](https://twitter.com/seldo) [@BenLesh](https://twitter.com/BenLesh) 1. Source maps are difficult to get right. Build performance vs resolution vs prod bundling means it never seems to just work
2. Import autocomplete is too slow (at least for TS 2.4)
3. It's hard to minimally polyfill (w/o polyfill.io)
