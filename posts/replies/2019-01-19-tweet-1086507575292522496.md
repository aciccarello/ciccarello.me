        If I was getting an android device just for WiFi Analyzer (and cared nothing about cell service or general features of a cell phone)...does anyone have recommendations? Basically as much of a brick with the best WiFi I could get.

[@Nick_Craver](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver) I can't speak for the relative wifi power but the Moto X4 is selling for pretty cheap right now.
