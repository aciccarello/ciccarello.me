      I'm spending wayyyy to much time making my own startpage for my browser. 


      I also now have two dashboard/landing pages - one on #notion for my
      to-dos/goals/progress (effectively personal data I want to track and a
      million checkboxes) and one for links (this startpage, in progress).


      I like setting myself up to make good clicking choices, especially when
      I'm bored and refreshing my browser. I'd rather play geography quizzes or
      browse an #indieweb links page or my #arena or findâ€¦

This looks so cool! I made my own (much more basic) [start page](https://start.ciccarello.me/) a while back. I cut back the features when I migrated off Glitch. But I love the core idea of designing your own experience.
