    content: Folks who want to see JPEG-XL supported in more browsers, what is it
      about the format that attracts you to its use on the web compared to
      currently supported formats?

By far, I would be most excited if browsers could handle progressive decoding on one image file rather than websites having to handle multiple file sizes.

I also like that it has lossless conversion with the existing JPEG format.
