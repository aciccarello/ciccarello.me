As someone who easily gets swept up in the challenge of IDing a bird, I really like the intentionality of mindful birding. When I notice a bird but can't seem to get a good enough look at it I can focus on it so much that I don't enjoy everything else around me. But birding is a great way to connect with nature and excuse to go outdoors.

Just this week, Sophia Wood describing her [daily birding log](https://www.streamof.me/birds/) reminded me how I've missed the intentionality of paying attention to the birds in my neighborhood. I could use some more mindfulness.

I also want to look more into the organizations they mentioned working to make birding accessible to more people. As hobbies go, birding has a pretty low barrier to entry. But the best birding spots should be available to people of all abilities so everyone can enjoy it.
