[Today I learned](/posts/tags/TIL/) that the Christmas Bird Count [started as an alternative to Christmas day "side hunts"](https://www.audubon.org/community-science/christmas-bird-count/history-christmas-bird-count).
Framing bird watching in contrast to hunting makes me want find some people to go birding with.
I just might have to [sign up](https://www.audubon.org/community-science/christmas-bird-count/join-christmas-bird-count) at some point.
