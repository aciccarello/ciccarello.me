    name: What Does EE UU Stand For?
    type: entry
    content: In Spanish, EE UU is an abbreviation for the US (United States). Learn why.

Today I learned that the Spanish phrase for the US "Estados Unidos" (EE.UU.) uses double letters because the word for "states" is plural.

Apparently we also do this in English with page (p.) vs pages (pp.).
