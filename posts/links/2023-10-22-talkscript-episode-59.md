    content: Migrating AMD modules to ES Modules and TypeScript is not a small task
      for a large codebase. Rene Rubalcava from the ArcGIS team shares their
      experience of upgrading thousands of lines of code and publishing raw ESM
      without stopping feature work. We also touch on how some of our “new”
      build tools are coming full circle with the past.
