I wish the technology industry operated with a longer term mindset. Even if we had highly efficient recycling programs (which we don't) our devices should last more than 2 years. I'm glad the right to repair movement has made some gains in recent years but we need to continue to tell companies we expect their products to last or we won't buy them.
