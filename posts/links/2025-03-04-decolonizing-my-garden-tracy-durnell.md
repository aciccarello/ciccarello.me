      bushes and a low azalea my colonized front yard when I moved in in 2013

      Gardens are colonized spaces: think of the quintessential American garden
      with its close-hewn evenly-green lawn of invasive grass, some matching
      cherubic flowers along the front of the house, maybe one tree or a couple
      flowering shrubs, lined by a manicured hedge or wall of arborvitae. This

So much inspiring stuff in this article from photos to transformations. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with our yard. San Diego's mild but dry climate leads to a lot of irrigation dependent landscaping in our area. I'd love to lean into plants that don't need so much help to survive.
I haven't invested the time or money into a major landscape project that would fundamentally change the yard we got when we moved in. Most of the planting has either been specific plants we love or transplanting plants our neighbors were getting rid of. I've also tried to embrace the existence of weeds as long as they aren't taking over or causing problems (like the burr clover that gets matted in our dogs' fur).
Water conscious planting is the main concern here. We also have to be fire conscious here. We need to avoid the easy-to-light tinder (often introduced species). There are so many layers to gardening that it's sometimes hard to move confidently in any direction. But my ultimate goal is to have a low maintenance yard full of native friendly plants.
