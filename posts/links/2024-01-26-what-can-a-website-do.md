I relate to this so much. It's important for me to remember how much of an impact I can make on people's experiences as a web developer. I've been trying to grow my skills in web accessibility and have made some progress over the years. But businesses often don't see the value in accessible user interfaces.

I'd love to help raise the bar for everyone's user experience on the web. I could advocate even more for that at work. But I'd also like to help clarify what accessibility looks like in practice. If I have questions, I'm sure other people do too.
