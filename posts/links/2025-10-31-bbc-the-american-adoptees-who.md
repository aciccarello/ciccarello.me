This is heartbreaking that our adoption system has failed to provide these adult adoptees with legal status. Clearly these people had no choice in coming to the US, should have been given citizenship long ago, and no place to return to. We should not leave people in legal limbo because their adoptive parents missed the right form. We need changes to our immigration laws.
