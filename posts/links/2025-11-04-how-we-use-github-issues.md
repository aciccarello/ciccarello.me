I historically haven't used GitHub discussions much but I like this process Zach (on the 11ty project) and
[Cory LaViska](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/how-i-use-git-hub-issues/) are recommending. Often feature requests need refinement before they can be made into actionable issues. So they can languish and make it harder to see the issues ready to work. Making discussions the default spot for before triage helps avoid that noise and clarify to viewers what commitments maintainers have made. I'm interested to see this process more in action and will consider it for any new open source projects.
