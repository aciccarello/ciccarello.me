I love hearing studies like this because it both validates my own experience and shows how to make birding more positive. I record bird counts for science but I definitely want to incorporate paying more attention to what birds I enjoy most. It elevates the mindfulness of birding. Each bird is unique and I love seeing what makes them special.
