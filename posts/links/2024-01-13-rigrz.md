      note: I like coffee. I don’t like celery. I’m an Aussie expat living in New York
        City. I know how to spell “onomatopoeia”… and I actually know what it
        means, too.
      locality: New York City
    content: "This week has been one of those times when I’ve had to continually
      remind myself of Hanlon’s Razor: “Never attribute to malice that which is
      adequately explained by stupidity.”"
