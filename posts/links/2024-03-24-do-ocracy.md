    content: A do-ocracy (also sometimes do-opoly, which is a more obvious pun on “duopoly”) is an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them. Responsibilities attach to people who do the work, rather than elected or selected officials.

Today I learned of the term do-ocracy which is a phenomenon I've witnessed but never had a name for.
I think it's helpful to acknowledge spaces where work is done by those who self-select and what impacts that can have on the community.
