Three years after our [first visit to Italy](/travel/2019/italy/), I was excited to be back.
This trip was also prompted by a work trip my wife was taking.
Her company was looking to bring all their employees together and flew everyone to Petratoli on the eastern side of Italy.
We took the opportunity to extend her trip and to celebrate our anniversary with a vacation.

This trip was primarily split between Florence, the Cinque Terre coast, and Lake Como.
