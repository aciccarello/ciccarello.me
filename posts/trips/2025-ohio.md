We came back to Ohio for a friend's wedding and stayed for an anniversary getaway.
Thanks to our friends for letting us crash in their basement and for taking some photos of Bekah and I.

It was also great seeing college friends, some after many years.
My friend Matt and I got almost a full round of disc golf in at one of Ohio's best courses.
We also saw one of the original Wright brothers planes at Carillon Historical Park.
Congrats to Erich on the wedding.
I'm so glad we could make it to celebrate with you two.

Even though we rented an economy car, the rental company gave us a Mercedes EV to drive around which was fun.
We made several stops at Dorthy Lane Market for treats like Killer Brownies and their pre-made meals bar.
