ðŸŽµ Listening to [Kind of Blue](https://album.link/us/i/268443092) by Miles Davis.

This is one of my favorite jazz albums of all time. My parents got it for me when I was a kid playing trumpet in the school band. Compared to some of the other music I listen to, this album feels restrained but no less powerful.
