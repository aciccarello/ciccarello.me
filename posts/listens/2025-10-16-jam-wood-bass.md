ðŸŽµ Listening to [Wood](https://song.link/y/SRUdoDLXL44) by [Taylor Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com/).

Shout out to [Stefan Pettersson](https://rougin.bandcamp.com/) from Sweden for his bass playing on the song Wood.
Their own records aren't quite my style but I'm glad they were asked to contribute.
Really killed it on that song.
I still haven't decided how I feel about the lyrics but it is one of the best bops on the album.

An honorable mention to Shellback's bass playing on Honey.
That also made me smile.
