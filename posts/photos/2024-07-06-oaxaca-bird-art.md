The birder in me loved this exhibit titled "<a href="https://fahho.mx/aviarium-cuarto-suspiro/" lang="es">Aviarium Cuarto Suspiro</a>" in <span lang="es">La Biblioteca de Investigación Juan de Córdova</span> in Oaxaca.
The exhibit used ceramics to flip the symbolism of the avian and human worlds to create fascinating shapes.
