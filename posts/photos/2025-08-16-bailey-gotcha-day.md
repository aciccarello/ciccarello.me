Ten years ago, we picked up the sweetest dog I've ever known.
She was excitable and loving; opinionated yet caring; goofy but always wanting to make you happy.
The last couple months [without her](/blog/2025/06/09/losing-bailey/) have been hard, but she is not forgotten.
We wish we could have her back, but her shadow is doing the best he can stepping into the role of lead dog.
No matter what, no one can ever replace Bailey.
