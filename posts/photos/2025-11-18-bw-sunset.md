These might be my last photos from Washington this year.
This was a cool sunset over the bay, but I like the contrast that came out when converted to black and white.
Even though I know the sun and sky were bright red, I like that the differences in darkness and textures is highlighted without the color.

This also seems like a fitting way to move past a week full of hardship.
Injuries, accidents, and insurance aren't what I wanted to start out the month, but I hope it gets better from here.
