Happy Birthday Bex.
With your infectious smile and thirst for life, you have shown me so much joy.
You have helped me expect more out of myself and others.
But also taught me how to have grace with myself when I fall short.
I'm proud of how you've faced adversity this year.
You've grown and stretched yourself so much from a year ago.
You are beautiful inside and out and hope others get to see what makes you great.
I wish you bright days ahead.
