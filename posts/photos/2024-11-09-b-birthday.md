This week we celebrated my wife's birthday.
I like our tradition of spreading the festivities over multiple days because this beautiful woman is worth celebrating for more than 24 hours.
She is a powerful force and brightens the day of the people she encounters while still pushing for a better world.
As a more reserved person, I am constantly amazed by how she connects with others and always looks to remind them they matter.
And so I relish the opportunity to celebrate her life for more than the culturally appointed time frame.
A little extra Bekah is a wonderful thing to have.

I'm grateful to be a part of her life and have the opportunity to experience the world together.
Her care and encouragement help me maintain perspective in busy and challenging times.
While she has had to overcome so much herself, she still manages to bring sunshine wherever she goes.
Thanks for letting me tag along.

Love you always. ðŸ˜˜
