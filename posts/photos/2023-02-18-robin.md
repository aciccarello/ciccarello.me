The San Diego robin irruption is real.
Our backyard has recently been filled with [American Robins](https://ebird.org/species/amerob).
I've counted at least 50 in our immediate yard and probably over 100 in the neighborhood.
It's a phenomenon that's been [seen all across San Diego County](https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/other/column-robins-are-flocking-to-san-diego-and-no-one-knows-why/ar-AA17mChW).
The birds which are rarely seen this far south have shown up in large numbers likely due to a storm or food shortage in their normal range.

Either way, it's been fun seeing them take over the yard for a few hours.
They haven't been here every day, but when they do, they feast on the Brazilian Pepper Tree fruits and fight over the bird bath.
One day I noticed a [Cedar Waxwing](https://ebird.org/species/cedwax/) following along in the trees and at the bath, though wary of the larger robins.
Our resident [Northern Mockingbird](https://ebird.org/species/normoc/) hasn't been too pleased with the visitors to it's territory.
The mocking bird only seems able to flush out a couple robins at a time.
But when the robins really get spooked, perhaps by a passing hawk, they fill the sky.
