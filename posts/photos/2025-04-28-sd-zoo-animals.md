We went back to the San Diego Zoo this weekend and I came home with some fun pictures.
I think my favorite animals to look at were the [White-fronted Bee-eater](https://ebird.org/species/wfbeat1).
Though the weaver birds in the same aviary exhibit were also impressive.
Despite a short downpour of rain, I had a great time both seeing the animals and hanging out with friends.

Reminds me of the stray bird that made it's way through New England a few years back.")
