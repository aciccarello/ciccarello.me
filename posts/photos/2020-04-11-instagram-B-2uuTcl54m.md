My [post about our time in Venice](/blog/2020/04/09/a-weekend-in-venice/) is finally posted! This is the last post in my series about our trip to Italy last October. The Doge's Palace, shown here, was one of the cool places we toured while staying in the city. When Venice was a regional power, the city's councils met in grand rooms like this to debate the state's future, often heavily lobbied by the various powerful guilds.
