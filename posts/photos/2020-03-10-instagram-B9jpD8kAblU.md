Getting out on the water with extended family was a nice way to end a weekend saying goodbye to a loved-one. I enjoyed meeting more of Bekah's family and talking birds with her uncles. I wish it could have been under better circumstances.
Honestly the kayaking was a little frustrating, fighting the current and wind, trying to keep up with everyone, and trying to not damage the camera. Bekah and I learned that two person kayaks are not as nice as they sound. But enjoying the peaceful scenery with family made it worth it.
