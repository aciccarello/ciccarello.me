I finished my blog post about Orvieto this weekend. It's a really cool town with lots of interesting history like how it was a Papal residence after the Pope was ousted from Rome. The town has this huge cathedral (or duomo) in the middle of town.

Unfortunately it will likely be a difficult year for people there as they deal with the COVID-19 and the loss of income from tourism. I'm really glad we were able to go see it last year.
