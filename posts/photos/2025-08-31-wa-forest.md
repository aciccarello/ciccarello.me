On our way to North Cascades national park we stopped at an old growth forest.
The scale of these trees was really staggering.
It's also cool to see how in a forest that old, you have generations of trees growing out of the downed trunks of previous generations.
And on top of that you have mosses that provide a place for ferns.
Standing in the forest I listened to chickadees and Pacific Wrens singing.
It was so peaceful and other-worldly.
