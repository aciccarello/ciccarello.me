We had a wonderful time in Ohio this week celebrating our anniversary.
I'd like to thank my wife for sticking by my side for so many years.
Life wouldn't be the same without you.
Your presence never ceases to bring me joy and excitement.
Not every day lives up to our expectations but each day with you is still meaningful and beautiful.
I hope for many more in the future.

After over a decade it finally feels like we are figuring out how to balance exploring and relaxing while on vacation.
It was great to spend a few days in the woods with the leaves turning.
The falls were a bit dry but the canyons were still impressive.
