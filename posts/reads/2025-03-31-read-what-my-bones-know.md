I was really impressed with this memoir. The author clearly has experience with great story telling from working radio stories. She uses that skill in this book to weave together the timeline of her own experience understanding how her body's complex PTSD works in response to childhood trauma. The book is about her experience, it's not a how-to, but it offered a look at how our understanding of mental health has changed from decades past until now. At the same time, it raises questions about how our current system is not efficient at treating mental health. I highly recommend this book for anyone in the foster care community or those working through childhood trauma.
