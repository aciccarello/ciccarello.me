When we got off the train platform in the town of Riomaggiore in Cinque Terre National Park, we were greeted by tall cliffs that opened out to the ocean. It wasn't untill we passed through a tunnel that we could truely see the stacked building the tight communities in the area are known for. From the narrow streets rise tall structures, often only on room wide but 5 stories tall. We dragged our suitcases down an alley and found our host's door open. Inside was an old winery storeroom that had been converted into a cluttered office.

We expected the usual check-in experience, but what we got instead was a history lesson. He welcomed us to the area and was glad to hear we liked wine and hiking. Despite their location on the sea, he described the local Ligurian people as "mountain people". While tourists flooded the towns daily for pictures of the ocean, in his view the real Cinque Terre was the hills and terraces that grew grapes.

Apparently, the Ligurians' business prowess helped them establish trade relations with the Catholic church to supply communion wine. The reflection of the sun off the ocean produced very sweet grapes. This strong flavor from the "two suns" is offset by the sea salt to produce great wine. Our host had his own vineyard and described how the men would cary baskets with 50 kg of grapes down the steep hills. We were admonished to experience the hills and wine with a trail map and a bottle of wine.

After our history lesson, we carried out bags up the two flights of stairs to our bedroom. Opening the window, it felt like we were right over the water. The harbor is tiny and the town feels incredibly small walking around. I threw on a bathing suit and we walked down to the water. Despite the beautiful view, there are only a handful of restaurants near the water. Around the corner is a rocky beach well populated with tourists. I took only a few steps into the Mediterranean before I noticed how alive the water was. Little fish would surround my ankles and jellies washed back and forth in the waves. I was afraid I'd be stung but there were other people in the water and I hadn't felt anything other than a fish possibly nibbling on my hand.

I got out and we continued out towards the jetty. Looking at a corner created in the rocks we could see hundreds of those jellyfish. From what I could determine, they don't sting but I wasn't confident enough to test that myself. We watched the sunset from the rocks. But instead of focusing on the water, the more striking view was the colorful gallery of the town glowing in the amber light.

The next day we planned a hike from Riomaggiore to Manarola, the next town over. Unfortunately Google's walking directions failed us in several ways. After stopping at Riomaggiore's castle tower, Google brought us down a narrow path that ended in a dead end. Then, as we started the steep climb hover the hill, we quickly realized the estimated time did not account for the elevation gain. Instead of an hour, it took us closer to 2 1/2 hours to reach the next town.

Still, it was a very insightful hike. As we climbed the hillside, we passed rows and rows of terraces for grape vines. Many of the plots were actively farmed but some were now overgrown. Winding along the path at shoulder hight was a single track propped up on stands. This monorail system is shared by the vinyards to help carry the harvest down the hillside. A task that perviously would be done on people's backs.

The views of both land and sea from the trail were beautiful. It was interesting seeing a large bridge spanning the canyon we were climbing and thinking about the days when these towns would have been more isolated, only accessible by sea or by these steep roads. As we decended into Manarola, we saw a different style town. The trail ended at a small square with a church and a bell tower. A road ran down the hillside, but through drains and under bridges you could see and hear the small stream that runs underneath. This road continues to almost the end of town which overlooks the harbor. It was as if the town had been built to stand on top of the stream and a wide street formed the main artery of town.

By midday when we arrived, Manarola was already packed with people. The large restaurant on the hillside was bustling and had a long wait time. (TK maybe move this conversation to the overview post) Where we at lunch we met an older lady and her daughter from somewhere in Orange County. She talked openly of her wealth, love of travel, and the travel-averse fiance she's never going to marry. Her view of travel was so striking. In many ways she celebrated the many interesting places to be found traveling. But at the same time she seemed closed off to discovering new things to enjoy; simply buying the experiences she liked. It made me keenly aware of how in many ways travel is a consumer good and how that "market" shapes what is offered in tourist destinations. I've read that Cinque Terre's colorful homes are more of an act of marketing than a historical style.

The waters in Manarola's harbor looked so inviting. There were people jumping off the tall rocky outcropping and others were sprawled out sunbathing on the ramp down to the water. It would be fun to come back and enjoy some time in the water here, even though there's no traditional beach. We also considered hiking to the next town of Corniglia but I was already developing blisters and both of us were tired. Instead we took the train back to Riomaggiore, grabbed our suitcases and continued on to Monterosso al Mare.

Monterosso al Mare, is the largest of the towns in Cinque Terre. It's actually split into two parts divided by a tunnel. To the south lies the historic part town, while to the north is the train station and the newer part of town that is more accessible to cars.
