**Will update this log with notable birds over the course of the year in preparation for the next post**

## California

## Washington

I attended the [Wings Over Water Birding Festival](https://www.wingsoverwaterbirdingfestival.com/) in Blaine Washington.
This was the first birding festival I've attended but I [had been wanting to do more social birding events](/posts/2024/12/16/til-cbc/).
We got the idea when a family member recently moved there and my wife and I stayed at their house less than 10 minutes away.
I wasn't sure what to expect and the schedule wasn't posted on the website until a month an a half before the event.
It was actually a packed schedule of talks, field trips, guided bird walks, a busy conference hall, and some manned birdwatching stations around Drayton Harbor and the surrounding bays.
Unfortunately many of the activities were filled up by the time I registered.
But I did sign up for the birding cruise.

On the first day, we attended a talk with David Drummond, an eccentric wildlife biologist who gave a talk on different owl species.
It was a condensed version of a multi-class course so he moved quickly through the content giving lots of interesting owl facts and showing some cool photos.
Owls really are incredibly specialized hunters, some able to pinpoint the location of a rodent under the snow purely by sound.
But even within the owl population, there is lots of variation.
As David talked through several different owl vocalization, I felt inspired to try to find a few more species of owls myself.

From there we went to the main hall, which was full of artists, conservation orgs, and volunteers with activities for children.
One organization, [Sardis Raptor Center](https://www.facebook.com/SardisRaptor/) brought in 3 birds for a family friendly presentation.
It was a little hard to hear, but they talked about the specialties of each species.
There was a Barred Owl, a Eurasian Eagle Owl, and a Bald Eagle.
It was really cool to see some owls in person right after the talk describing their biology.
While not native to the Americas, the size and activeness of the Eurasian Eagle Owl was particularly impressive.
It made the Barred Owl look small in comparison.
But from the talk earlier, I had learned that America's smallest owl, the Elf Owl is even smaller, smaller than a robin.
We also learned about the different fishing styles of Bald Eagles vs Ospreys.
They have different claw arrangements, different approaches to finding fish, carry the fish differently, and have very different hunting styles.
Ospreys will actually splash down into the water to grab fish, while eagles try to pluck fish off the top of the water while staying dry.

After leaving the conference center, my fater-in-law and I boarded a boat for a trip around the harbor.
Historically, I've struggled to identify birds that are out in salt water.
The similar colorations and constant waves make it hard to distinguish species.
So it was really helpful to be on the top deck of a boat with other birders able to call out where different species were.
We didn't go very far in the boat but we saw a lot of birds.
While on the boat I saw 4 new species, including a [Yellow-billed Loon](https://ebird.org/species/yebloo).
The weather was cold exposed to the wind, but thankfully we had a break in the rain and could stay dry.

In the evening, I attended the Keynote presentation by [Lyanda Lynn Haupt](https://www.lyandalynnhaupt.com/).
She gave a passionate presentation about how inspiring the avian world is both in it's complexity and it's familiarity.
She also shared her experience raising a Starling in the process of writing one of her books.
