Went looking for San Diego's escaped flamingos.
Ran into a Cornell Lab Tour Group.

## New Jersey

One of my NYC trips I spent two nights in Jersey City.
In that time I had exactly one morning where I went outside to bird.
Somehow in the 25 minutes I braved the winter morning in a small Marina park, I stumbled upon a [Swamp Sparrow](https://ebird.org/species/swaspa), a new lifer, in the small patch of grass in the park.
To make the contrast betwen this patch of nature and the bustle of the city more stark, 36 hours before on that same sidewalk I was passed by an Aviride delivery robot.

## Connecticut

June, December

Made a final push to reach my 200 species goal.
Went to Hammonasset Beach State Park, someone else pointed out a [Purple Sandpiper](https://ebird.org/species/pursan) among some [Dunlin](https://ebird.org/species/dunlin) and [Ruddy Turnstone](https://ebird.org/species/rudtur).
A couple walked by and asked what I was looking at, when I replied that there was a [Golden-crowned Kinglet](https://ebird.org/species/gockin), she said that was one of her father's favorite birds.

Walking around a [Northern Harrier](https://ebird.org/species/norhar2) floated over the marsh.
I enjoyed the familiarity of [Northern Cardinals](https://ebird.org/species/norcar) in bright red in the dull winter brush and [Black-capped Chickadee](https://ebird.org/species/bkcchi) boldly foraging a few feet away.

On the last day of the year I went out one more time.
I spent 10 minutes trying to locate the tapping of a woodpecker, it was the [Yellow Sapsucker](https://ebird.org/species/yebsap) I've been looking for.
As I walked around the grounds of Gillette Castle State Park, a flock of [Dark-eyed Junco](https://ebird.org/species/daejun) and [White-throated Sparrow](https://ebird.org/species/whtspa) hopped across the trail.
Then a [Winter Wren](https://ebird.org/species/winwre3) buzzed by.
As I walk down the trail it seemed very annoyed that was continued on my way.
