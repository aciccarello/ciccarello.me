Three years after our [first visit to Italy](/blog/2019/11/27/we-traveled-to-italy/), I'm excited to be back. This trip was also prompted by a work trip my wife was taking. Her company was looking to bring all their employees together and flew everyone to Petratoli on the eastern side of Italy. We took the opportunity to extend her trip and to celebrate our anniversary with a vacation.

- Lots of sandwiches and gelato
- Avoided renting a car, took lots of trains
- Recommend reserving trains ahead of time if you want the most options for train times and seats together.
- Got an Italian SIM card instead of using Verizon international plan
- Had snafu with return flight
- Balance between maximizing trips/photos/memories and being present/exploring/getting to know an area and contrast internet/influencer culture

## Rome

- I arrived in Rome around noon and took the train to downtown
- Had a rough experience with a taxi driver
- Met Bekah's coworkers for lunch
- Left for Florence
