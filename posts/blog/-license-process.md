We have not gone through the foster parent licensing process twice.
In theory, you could get licensed in a year, however in our experience it has taken about 2 years both times.
Some of that comes down to inefficient processes, but most steps exist to ensure foster parents are sufficiently screened to protect children in the foster system and to ensure parents are prepared.

Each state and county has its own process.
Furthermore, in California you can be licensed directly with the county or through a private agency who is licensed by the county.
We chose to work with an agency and live in San Diego so the steps will likely be different elsewhere but should still be representative.

Becoming a foster parent involves many steps, but the basic process includes:

1. Initial conversations & screening
1. Basic documentation and background checks
1. Training
1. Home Study Documentation, Interviews, and Inspection
1. Respite care

Each of these steps become increasingly detailed and personal.
A well organized agency should have clear processes to make it easy to keep track of where you are in the process.

## Initial Conversations

Becoming a foster parent starts with reaching out to a local agency.
I highly recommend looking into more than one, as some agencies may specialize in specific ages or situations.
We reached out to 4 agencies and registered to attend "info session" video calls where the agency gives a quick overview about what foster parenting is like and to answer questions.
These calls help you understand the agency, and help screen out people who are not ready for the commitment.

## Basic Documentation

After deciding to move forward, the agency will usually assign someone to discuss fostering in more depth and work with you through the application process.
This begins the first round of paperwork.
During this stage, we submitted our background checks, got fingerprinted, and shared references.
We also had to submit documentation of our personal, medical, DMV history and financial statements.

The first time we got licensed, we had significant delays getting our background checks.
The checks are run through state agencies and apparently ours got lost when the state changed systems.
Out of state background checks also take longer, so it can help if you've lived in-state for a while (in California 5 years).

## Training

Once your background check comes back clear (or sometimes while waiting), you'll likely need to attend some foster care training with the agency.
In our case, the classes were about 8 hours total.
These classes worked through all the requirements foster parents are expected to follow and the agency's process for documenting them.
There are a lot of details to follow so these classes are important.
But we also met some good friends during these classes.

In addition to training on the foster care process, both agencies also required online training in child attachment.
Despite being lengthy, we found these classes to be very interesting.
Working with children in foster care may require you to change how you view child behavior.
Rather than seeing negative behavior as "acting out" the behaviors can often be described in terms of the child's unmet attachment need.
So for us, these trainings helped reshape how we approach children to be more aware of the underlying needs of the children.
