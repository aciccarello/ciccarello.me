## Kickoff

On New Year's Day we had a kickoff call which ended up being a good opportunity to introduce people to the project.
Several people installed Omnibear and tried it out, either with their own site or with commentpara.de.
Micropub is a feature not everyone has on their site so it was cool to talk about the value of it.
I also appreciated the feedback on user flows and the website language.
