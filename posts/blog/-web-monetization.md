For a long time I've been interested in different models for making money from websites.
It seems the default model is ads, which are often obnoxious, privacy violating, and slow; all of which makes a terrible user experience.

## Traditional Models:
- Ads:
  - Banner, popups, videos
  - Referrals
- Subscription
  - Paywall: Not open
  - Commissions: Sponsored
  - Patrons: Donations
- Selling stuff 
  - Store: Selling a brand
  - Advertising other services

## New
- [Flattr](https://flattr.com/)
- [Scroll](https://scroll.com/)
- [Coil](https://coil.com/) & [Web Monetization API](https://webmonetization.org/)
