## Canada

Okay, this feels like cheating, but I did log a crow siting while in Peace Arch Park on the border with Canada.
It's a special place where Americans and Canadians can meet without needing to go through normal customs as long as they stay in the park.
But I really should plan a trip into British Columbia for some real birding.

## Connecticut

I visited my home state twice in 2024, once in the spring, and again in November.
Unsurprisingly, I was much more successful in the spring as the birds were busy claiming territory and raising young.
The two lifers were a [Wood Thrush](https://ebird.org/species/woothr) which I heard singing it's metallic call out in the woods.
I was able to both see and hear a [Great Crested Flycatcher](https://ebird.org/species/grcfly/) while visiting a family member's house.
Due to a steep hill, their house feels like it is up in the trees, so the flycatcher was at eye level.

While the two lifers were more serendipitous observations, I did have some time to go out in more natural spaces.
I saw 25 species at Rocky Neck State Park, which is a family favorite place to camp.
My mother also introduced me to the [Roger Tory Peterson Estuary Center](https://ctaudubon.org/rtp-estuary-home/) in Old Lyme.
The home was the former home of the conservationist, artist, and field guide writer.
It's now managed by the CT Audubon Society, and is a beautiful place to walk around in the spring, even if it was threatening to rain on us.
