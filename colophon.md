## About this Site

This site is intended to serve as my personal home on the web. I write about many different topics that interest me for fun. It's part profile, part public journal, part playground.

In many ways it serves as an excuse to push myself and use (or not use) different
technologies. In this case using a simplified tool-set is an intentional exercise to help me think more about the layout and styles I use.
At the same time I hope to improve the performance of the site and experimenting with optimizations.

## Technology

The code for this website is on [GitHub](https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The build is processed using [Eleventy](11ty.dev) a static site generator for node. Originally this site was hosted on GitHub pages with a Jekyll build.

The styles of this site are a combination of hand-written styles and [Material Components for the Web](https://material.io/components/).
The site uses the [Roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto#glyphs) (self hosted). Included are some SVG icons from [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline).
Other icons (like logos) are made by [Pixel perfect](https://icon54.com/) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)

This site currently uses CloudFlare analytics due to its better privacy policy and limited performance impact. Previously I've used GoatCounter.

If there is an problem with this website or improvement you'd like to suggest, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/issues) or reach out directly.
