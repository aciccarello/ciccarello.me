A friend shared this recipe with an over the top title, but we've made it several times now and we love it. The key is cooking the skin-on chicken on top of vegetables is a delicious combination of flavors. It's a decent amount of prep to cut the vegetables but it cooks in a single pan making cleaning easier.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 1 hr
- Cook Time: 50 minutes

{% recipe-ingredients %}

This list is intentionally imprecise, you can adjust the amounts based on your favorite flavors. But the goal is to cover the bottom of the pan loosely with vegetables.

### Recommended

- Skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
- Onion
- Carrots
- Potatoes
- Cauliflower
- Green Beans
- Olive Oil
- Salt
- Pepper

### Optional

You can add additional vegetables as you like, however you'll want to avoid anything to soft that will ooze juice and prevent the other vegetables from becoming crisp (i.e. <em>NOT</em> mushrooms, zucchini, squash, and broccoli).

- Rosemary or thyme
- Lemon or orange zest
- Different kinds of potatoes (e.g. sweet potatoes, red potatoes)
- Different kinds of onions
{% endrecipe-ingredients %}

{% recipe-directions %}
1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees
1. Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner or heavy duty foil
1. Cut your vegetables, sizing them into roughly bite size pieces adjusted for cooking speed
1. Toss vegetables with olive oil, lots of salt & pepper, and whatever seasonings you'd like
1. Peel the skin back from the chicken (leaving part attached) and pad dry with a paper towel
1. Season the chicken with salt, pepper and (optionally) lemon/orange zest
1. Arrange the vegetables on the baking sheet in a single layer
1. Place the chicken skin side up on the vegetables
1. Bake at 500 degrees for 50 minutes
{% endrecipe-directions %}

By the time you're done, the chicken skin should be crisp and the vegetables should be starting to brown.
