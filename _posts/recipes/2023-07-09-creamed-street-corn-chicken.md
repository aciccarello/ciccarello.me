1. In a bowl, combine the chili powder, paprika, red or cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt.
1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper
1. Dredge the checken through a bowl of the eggs and then through a bowl of flour. Coated pieces can be placed on a plate
1. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
1. Add the chicken and cook on both sides until golden, about 5 minutes per side.
1. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
1. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion to the same skillet. Cook until soft, 5 minutes. If you have raw corn kernals, you can add them now.
1. Add the canned corn, zucchini, green onions, garlic, 2 teaspoons of the spice mix, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the corn is softened, 5 minutes.
1. Reduce the heat to low. Mix in the cream cheese until melted and creamy.
1. Stir in the milk and 1/2 cup water before adding back the chicken into the sauce. Cook until warmed through, 5 minutes.
1. In a separate skillet, lightly brown the butter until golden. Add 3 teaspoons of the spice mix, then remove from the heat.
1. Mix the Greek yogurt/mayo and lime juice with a pinch of salt to form a creamy sauce.
1. Serve the chicken topped with spicy butter, creamy sauce, avocado, green onions, cotija, and (optionally) grilled corn.
