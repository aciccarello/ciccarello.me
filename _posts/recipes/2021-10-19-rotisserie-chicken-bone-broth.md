We often buy a whole rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, especially at Costco. For a while we'd just toss the bones afterward but it's fairly easy to make chicken broth with the leftover carcass. Throwing it in a slow cooker with water overnight help loosen up some of the hard to reach meat. It's also a great base for chicken noodle soup if you're patient enough to pick out and save the vegetables.
