This recipe is a Hoesterey family favorite.
You can see a version of it on the [King's Hawaiian Website](https://kingshawaiian.com/recipes/Hawaiian-Ham-Swiss-Slider) since the sweet rolls make the base of this smothered sandwich.
We've halved the servings, added caramelized onions, and adjusted the seasonings so adjust to your liking.
You could also put the onion sauce inside the roll if you want a less messy sandwich.
