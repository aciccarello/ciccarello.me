Hoesterey family recipe from Bekah's Noonie. You'll want a good candy thermometer to avoid burning the whole batch. Doubling the recipe is NOT recommended.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 5 minutes
- Cook Time: 60 minutes
- Servings: plenty

{% recipe-ingredients %}

- 3 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 cup white corn syrup
- 3/4 cup water
- 3 cup Raw Spanish peanuts
- 2 1/2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon vanilla
- 1 tablespoon soda
{% endrecipe-ingredients %}

{% recipe-directions %}

1. Measure ingredients and prepare buttered baking sheet so everything is ready as soon as the desired temperature is reached.
1. Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water & cook to 230°F (110°C). Stir to avoid burning. If the mixture foams, the heat may be too high.
1. Add peanuts and cook to 305°F (152°C). Be aware that the temperature may jump rapidly as it nears 300°. If the temperature doesn't get hot enough, the result will by chewy. Too hot will be extra brittle.
1. Remove from heat and add the remaining ingredients (butter, vanilla, and baking soda). Stir until mixed.
1. Pour on extra large buttered sheet (or two standard baking sheets).
1. Using a spatula and spoon, pull or stretch smaller chunks onto other sheets until as thin as desired. As it cools, it will get cool enough to pull by hand
1. Let cool, then break into serving size pieces
