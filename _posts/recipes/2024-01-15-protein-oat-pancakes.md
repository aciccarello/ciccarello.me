We were looking for a higher protein breakfast that didn't just taste like eggs and found this recipe from [bbcgoodfood.com](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/easy-protein-pancakes){.u-remix-of}.

We would like to try adding another scoop of protein powder to increase the protein content more but might need to adjust for consistency.
Some other recipes we've looked at also added greek yogurt which would be interesting to try.
