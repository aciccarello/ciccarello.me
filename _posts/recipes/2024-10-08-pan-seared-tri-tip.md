Tri-tip is a popular cut of meat in California and a treat for our family.
Cooking it is fairly simple, but I am always nervous to screw up an expensive cut of meat so I've written down our process.
This goes great with potatoes and green beans.

You can also adjust this for grilling by starting with a really hot grill before lowing the heat.

## Summary

- Prep Time: 10 minutes (plus optional time to bring the steak closer to room temperature)
- Cook Time: 40 minutes
- Servings: 6

## Ingredients

- Tri-tip steak
- 1/2 teaspoon Garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons Salt
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to {% recipe-temp 425 %}.
1. Prepare the meat by patting it dry and seasoning generously with salt and pepper (should have a noticeable layer).
1. Add oil to a large oven-safe pan and heat on the stove on high.
1. When the oil is hot, place the tri-tip in the pan and cook about 5 minutes per side (fatty side first). The oil should be sizzling and so you may want a splatter guard.
1. Move pan to the oven and cook 20-35 minutes. (about 10 minutes per pound of meat).
1. Once the internal temperature of the steak reaches your desired level, remove from the tri-tip from the oven and cover with foil and let rest 5 minutes. The internal temperature should rise about 5 °F after exiting the oven.
1. Slice against the grain and serve

## Target internal temperatures

- Rare: 120 – 125 °F
- Medium-rare: 130 – 135 °F
- Medium: 140 – 145 °F
- Well Done: 150 – 155 °F
