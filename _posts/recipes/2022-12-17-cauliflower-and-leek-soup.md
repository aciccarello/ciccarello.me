This recipe was initially based on Bethany Kramer's [Vegan Creamy Cauliflower Soup](https://asimplepalate.com/blog/creamy-cauliflower-soup-vegan/) recipe from  "A Simple Palate". However we've added a few non-vegan ingredients. Consider doubling if you have a lot of cauliflower. The result should be a creamy, slightly thick soup.

## Summary
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook Time: 20 minutes
- Servings: 4 servings

{% recipe-ingredients %}
- 3 leeks, cleaned and chopped (consider additional rinse after chopping)

{% recipe-directions %}
1. Sauté the leeks and onions in a large pot on low to medium heat with a pinch of salt in oil or butter for 5 minutes.
1. Add minced garlic and thyme sprigs to sautéed vegetables, stir for 30 seconds. 
1 Add cauliflower, broth, white beans, and salt & black pepper & simmer covered for 12-15 minutes until cauliflower is soft.
1. While the soup simmers, cook some sausage in a pan until fully cooked. Keep to the side.
1. Remove thyme sprigs and puree the soup using a blender or immersion blend until creamy and smooth.
