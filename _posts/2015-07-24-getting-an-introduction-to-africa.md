The past two days have destroyed my sense of time. Between changing time zones
twice, flying through the night, flying for more than 6 hours at a time,
having periodic naps, and standing in lines for long stretches, I have stopped
keeping a close eye on time. I guess that is a fitting entrance to Africa.  
On Tuesday I was counting every minute making sure I worked enough hours for
the week and rushing through getting out the door to make our plane on time.
This afternoon we didn't have to manage ant firm times for events to happen.
Our plan was to fly directly from Brussels to Monrovia, Liberia. God
apparently had other plans. After about four hours into our "last flight" to
Liberia the pilots decided it was necessary to divert the flight to Senegal,
several countries up the west coast of Africa.We would fid out later that some
unexpected bad weather had caused a crack in the windshield of the airplane
and the Dakar airport was better prepared to make the repairs.

We followed the mass of other displaced travelers out of the airport to where
bus after bus came to shuttle people and their luggage to our hotel. But this
long wait provided us with an opportunity to connect with the other people on
our flight to Monrovia including native Liberians and humanitarian/missions
workers. This first look at Africa was a great introduction to the differences
in culture that we may have to face. I enjoyed looking at the way people
dressed, how they interacted with each other, and how the English speaking
Liberians interacted with the primarily French speaking Senegal workers. When
our boxes finally got loaded on a bus and we packed inside, we got a small
tour of the city on the way to our hotel. I was reminded of many scenes from
Bekah and my trip to Kosovo in eastern Europe last year. Things like the
concrete buildings, the mix of businesses, and people standing around. But
there were also significant differences. Dakar Senegal had more poverty, more
English, and more social/open people than Mitrovica, Kosovo. It was great to
explore this new world.

As we arrived at the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised to find our temporary
housing was a upscale place. We were able to get an ocean view room and meal
all provided by Brussels Airlines. After so much traveling, it was a blessing
to be able to relax (and take a shower).

Things are still up in the air for our real final flight to Liberia but for
being stick for a while, we are pretty well off. We will also be looking to
see how God uses this delay. Update: Our flight to Monrovia has been set for
Sunday meaning we will be in Senegal another day.
