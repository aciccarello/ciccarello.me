    name: How often do you get to rewrite and rethink?

    content: This may be a uniquely cultural thing at CodePen. This company has
      never really been run with the goal of moving fast, scaling up, selling
      out and riding off into the sunset clutching bags of money - code quality
      be damned. It’s been kind of the opposite, really, a slow and steady
      approach. I’m encouraged to think and re-think through how and why I’ve
      approached a problem any particular way instead of being pressured to
      finish quickly and move on to the next thing.

This tension resonates with me. Reworking code is an investment in the team's future. But judging and justifying investments is not easy.
