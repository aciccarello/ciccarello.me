    name: Russell Moore on 'altar call for Evangelical America'
    post-type: interview
    content: Well, it was the result of having multiple pastors tell me essentially
      the same story about quoting the Sermon on the Mount parenthetically in
      their preaching - turn the other cheek - to have someone come up after and
      to say, where did you get those liberal talking points? And what was
      alarming to me is that in most of these scenarios, when the pastor would
      say, I'm literally quoting Jesus Christ, the response would not be, I
      apologize. The response would be, yes, but that doesn't work anymore.
      That's weak. And when we get to the point where the teachings of Jesus
      himself are seen as subversive to us, then we're in a crisis.

It was really validating hearing Russell Moore articulate the feeling of being an outsider in an American church that seems more and more disconnected from the origins of Christianity. I've spoken with so many people who no longer feel okay with the church culture we see today. More broadly I hope the country can recover from this period of political tension and "ends justify the means" approaches to conflict. But within Christianity I hope we also take a step back and rethink what a church is and how to engage with people we might disagree with.
