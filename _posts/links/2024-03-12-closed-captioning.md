      Open captioning is when the synchronized transcription is "burned into"
      the video â€” i.e., added to the actual pixels of the video using some
      video-editing software.


      Closed captioning is when the synchronized transcription is supplied as metadata for the video or sent as an additional file, which allows the captions to be turned on and off.

Today I learned what the "closed" in closed captioning means. It's the ability to turn the captions off rather than having the text as part of the video.

Ben's post is also a good reminder of the difference between captions and subtitles.
