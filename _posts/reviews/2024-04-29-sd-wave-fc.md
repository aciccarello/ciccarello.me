The San Diego Wave is a NWSL soccer team hosting games at Snapdragon Stadium in Mission Valley.
The Wave roster includes USA National Team players like Alex Morgan and Naomi Girma.

We went to our first game in April of 2024 and I was impressed by the whole experience.
When we arrived there were a lot of people tailgating in the parking lot.
We opted for prepaid parking, but there is also a lightrail station on-site.
The newly built Snapdragon Stadium is a nice venue and the Wave do a good job of making it their own for the games.
I picked up a hat from the merch store on the Southeast side of the stadium.
There are plenty of food vendors on the upper level including game staples like hot dogs and alcohol, but also food like Acai bowls (which we enjoyed).
The sun was already setting when we went, but I could see it getting hot during the day.

The Wave made full use of the field with high quality A/V and special effects.
We had seats 3 rows from the southwest corner which were a great value.
However, the biggest screen was behind us (a smaller screen was on the opposite corner) and you'd be able to see more of the action from midfield.
The fans were definitely engaged with the game, covered with team gear, yelling at the ref, and reacting to every play.
We could hear the drums and cheers of the supporters section across the field on the north side.

The wave's playing style was physical, and they were given a yellow card withing the first 10 minutes of the game.
They took the lead in the first half with an impressive shot between 3 defenders.
Early in the second half Bay FC tied it up after several touches off of a corner.
But the Wave finished strong with a goal right in front of us.

Overall, the game was a lot of fun to watch and a great fan experience.
We're hoping to go to more games in the future.
Between tickets, fees, and parking, the game cost us $130.
On top of that we also bought some gear and a snack.
Next time I'd like to try to find tickets closer to midfield and look for cheaper parking options.
