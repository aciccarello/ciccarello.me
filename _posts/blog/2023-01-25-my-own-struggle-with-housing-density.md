I like the idea of denser cities. I like being able to walk places. 

I also like having more personal space, an area to garden, privacy.

I don't like having to hear my neighbors arguments or smell their smoking.

I don't want to see continuous suburban sprawl take over natural areas or perpetuate the inefficient, car-centric culture we currently have.

I don't know how to hold the tension of these preferences. I've lived in apartments and I've lived in single family homes.
