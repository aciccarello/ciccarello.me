    Since writing this post, I've moved away from Twitter. To see why, read <a href="/blog/2023/10/23/rethinking-social-media/">Rethinking my approach to social media</a>.

My friends and family often ask me about my Twitter account which is
frequently filled with web development specific comments like this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I never cease to be impressed with the number of <a href="https://twitter.com/npmjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@npmjs</a> packages <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sindresorhus</a> authors. Appearing in 5 of the 20 search results I see.</p>&mdash; Anthony Ciccarello (@ajciccarello) <a href="https://twitter.com/ajciccarello/status/880483311637934081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

For the majority of people who are not familiar with
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or the work of [Sindre
Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com), don't worry. You are not expected to get
it. Tweets like this are not directed at the general public but rather at a
specific software developer who has done a lot of work for the JavaScript
community. While Twitter is a vast community, it was the chatter of unique
communities within the Twitterverse that ultimately pulled me in.

For many years I didn't see the point of Twitter. Facebook had done a good job
of adding features to make Twitter technically unnecessary. Facebook allows
public posts and allows you to [follow](https://www.facebook.com/help/follow/)
people without friending them. So from my perspective, if I wanted to let the
world what I was [eating for lunch](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lunch) I could
just post it on Facebook. But social groups have different cultures and
Facebook had already developed a reputation for close-knit private sharing.

Meanwhile, the more I dove into front-end web development, the more references
I saw to conversations on Twitter by high-profile developers. Blog posts
frequently referred to recommendations or controversies that were being
discussed 140 characters at a time. It was this active community of developers
sharing ideas in an informal medium that really intrigued me.

So I created an account. At first, I just followed other people. It was really
interesting to see the topics that other software developers were discussing.
At the time I was the only frontend developers on my team and wasn't connected
with people who were trying out technologies like
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), so hearing the experiences of other
developers was valuable to me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/arahansen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@arahansen</a> I have no need of gulp plugins. Everything I do is with webpack. I just fire it off with npm scripts.</p>&mdash; Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds) <a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/677566822133071874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2015</a></blockquote>

As time went on, I became more comfortable and started engaging more with the
platform. Attending [ng-conf](https://www.ng-conf.org/) was a turning point
for me because almost all of the speakers were using their Twitter account as
their public profile. I began to see more how the platform provided an
opportunity to engage with leaders in the community.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Impressed with the <a href="https://twitter.com/code?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@code</a> snippets shown at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ngconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ngconf</a> . Nice work <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Papa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@John_Papa</a></p>&mdash; Anthony Ciccarello (@ajciccarello) <a href="https://twitter.com/ajciccarello/status/727908615122620417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2016</a></blockquote>

Following ng-conf I started connecting more with developers through Twitter.
Sometimes it was simply re-tweeting a post I thought deserved more attention
(even if I signaled Twitter's algorithms more than the few followers I had).
But other times I asked questions of people in the web development community I
would not have normally contacted. In this way Twitter has opened up a world
of professional advice and information.

Since joining Twitter, I've expanded my use to include sharing interesting
links or sending feedback to the public relations employees of companies I've
interacted with. However, I still see Twitter as a professional tool. It
offers the opportunity to glean from software developers who care about
improving the web platform. These individuals fill a mentorship role that
isn't always readily available within work organizations and provide an
outside perspective that has helped me make decisions at work.

Twitter is a great way to tap into public conversations. Occasionally I add my
voice but there are a lot of conversations going on that don't matter to me.
As a web developer, I have found a niche where I feel comfortable. In this
space, Twitter has become a great resource to learn more about industry
standards and where the software community is headed. So while many might be
confused by what I share, I want to continue to engage with the part of
Twitter that has helped me to grow as a software engineer.
