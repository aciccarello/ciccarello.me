**Will update this log with notable birds over the course of the year in preparation for the next post**

## California

Saw [Swinhoe's White-eye](https://ebird.org/species/swiwhe1/) in the plants on the bluff above the beach while at the tidepools with our friends. I've been interested in seeing that since seeing a few local sightings at locations in town. It is native to south-east Asia but has established itself in Southern California.
