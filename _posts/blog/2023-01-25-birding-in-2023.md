**Will update this log with notable birds over the course of the year in preparation for the next post**

## California

Saw [Swinhoe's White-eye](https://ebird.org/species/swiwhe1/) in the plants on the bluff above the beach while at the tidepools with our friends. I've been interested in seeing that since seeing a few local sightings at locations in town. It is native to south-east Asia but has established itself in Southern California.

### Robins!

San Diego saw record numbers of [American Robins](https://ebird.org/species/amerob) this February. While you might find a few hanging around neighborhoods normally, flocks in the hundreds are very rare. I did get some [great pictures of them in the back yard](/posts/2023/02/18/robin/)

### Feb 26

Had a free afternoon and went birding at the Buena Vista Lagoon and some nearby areas. Ended up with a total of 38 species identified on the day. A [Great Egret](https://ebird.org/species/greegr/) greeted me from the railing of a dock as I entered the trail. There was an olive-yellow Pacific-slope Flycatcher hanging out behind the fence at Maxton Brown Park which normally isn't around this early. I also learned to ID [Sora](https://ebird.org/species/sora/) by ear. Heard more than one! There were quite a few [Allen's Hummingbirds](https://ebird.org/species/allhum/) around everywhere, often fighting for territory.

## Mexico

Stayed a night in Tijuana to visit some friends from Puebla who had come to the embassy (consolute?) there. It was really good to see them and catch up. I didn't really do any birding but logged a couple while waiting in line at the border for 3 hours. I think our friends got home faster than we did even with a commercial flight!
