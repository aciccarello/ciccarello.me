I've been part of the IndieWeb community for a while, mostly via online meetups and a community chat group but I was excited to finally meet people in person when San Diego was chosen as a location for an IndieWebCamp.


The IndieWeb is a community of personal websites connected by simple standards, based on a few key principles. Part of the appeal is that people come with different values and ideas for how they want to use their websites but come together to make things work well together. So IndieWebCamps are an opportunity to brainstorm and build those ideas, seeing what other people are doing and getting to know them.


I wasn't sure what to expect but I was looking forward to meeting people I've communicated with for 2 and a half years. I knew it would be a small group
