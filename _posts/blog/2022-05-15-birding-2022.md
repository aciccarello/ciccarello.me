This is a WIP post so I don't have to remember everything next year when I publish this.

## May 13th
Decided to go birding at a Wildlife Sanctuary on a whim. Ended up spending 2.5 hours there and was three new species; [Yellow-breasted Chat](https://ebird.org/species/yebcha), [Ash-throated Flycatcher](https://ebird.org/species/astfly/), and [Clark's Grebe](https://ebird.org/species/clagre/). While I had seen them before, I was really impressed by the [Western Grebes](https://ebird.org/species/wesgre/) I saw which are almost identical to the Clark's, save for slightly more of a dark cap that drops below the eyes. I had previously seen them from a distance, way off shore. But here I saw one probably 20 feet away and I was impressed by its large size, it's majestic black and white plumage, bright red eyes, and the square top of it's head.

I was surprised with how close many of the birds would let me be. One bright blue [Tree Swallow](https://ebird.org/species/treswa/) circled my head 4 times. One bird was too close for my binoculars to focus. Lots of goslings of [Canada Geese](https://ebird.org/species/cangoo)
There were large colonies of Terns and Skimmers; ocean loving birds with narrow wings and big bills. At one point someone (hopefully a researcher) walked out to the [Caspian Tern](https://ebird.org/species/caster1) colony and they all began flying in circles in the air. Over at the next pond, [Black Skimmers](https://ebird.org/species/blkski) collected on a small island. Down by the river a [Forster's Tern](https://ebird.org/species/forter) would hover over the water before diving down for a fish.
In all I saw over 45 species.

## May 14th: Global Big Day
I really leaned into the Big Day this May and spent 5 hours birding and adding up 55 species. I had been hoping to see a [Swinhoe's White-eye](https://ebird.org/species/swiwhe1/) which is typically found in Southeast Asian but has been reported nearby. Identified a [Pacific-slope Flycatcher](https://ebird.org/species/pasfly) for the first time. Spent probably 20 minutes waiting for it to return so I could be sure. Lots of very cute grey fluffballs known as [Bushtit](https://ebird.org/species/bushti) hoping among bushes as a flock looking for bugs. Saw more bright [Yellow Warblers](https://ebird.org/species/yelwar) than I was expecting up in the trees. But I got a great look at a female [Wilson's Warbler](https://ebird.org/species/wlswar) at the end of one of my hikes. They are also almost fully yellow but with a cute, short bill. The herons, especially the [Snowy Egrets](https://ebird.org/species/snoegr) were active in our local seasonal river though they seemed more focused on defending the best fishing spots than actually catching fish.

## Connecticut
Visited family for Grandpa's birthday party. Was up on the third floor and saw a [Pileated Woodpecker](https://ebird.org/species/pilwoo) fly over the driveway. I'd been looking for one for a while and as the largest woodpecker in America it is iconic.
Also went to the beach and saw [Purple Martins](https://ebird.org/species/purmar/) at a nesting colony at the nature center. There were [Blue Jays](https://ebird.org/species/blujay/) in an aviary inside the nature center and a camera on an [Osprey](https://ebird.org/species/osprey/) nest with a few young birds. The ospreys were actively fishing and we saw several dive into the water and fly away with a fish. The surprising finds were a [Brown Thrasher](https://ebird.org/species/brnthr/) and [Laughing Gull](https://ebird.org/species/laugul/) in it's breeding hood. There was a nice pond just behind the dunes that had plenty of shore birds including a [Glossy Ibis](https://ebird.org/species/gloibi/). There was a [Little Blue Heron](https://ebird.org/species/libher/) next to a [Snowy Egret](https://ebird.org/species/snoegr/). Both are fairly active hunters but the snowy egret was had an interesting strategy where it would swirl one leg in the water and lurch forward to find what fish was spooked.
Went birding in the morning, had to dodge the rain but got excited when I heard a [Scarlet Tanager](https://ebird.org/species/scatan) which we had just talked about the day before. I walked up and down the street looking for it before spotting the bright red dot high in the trees. I also tracked down an [Eastern Wood-Pewee](https://ebird.org/species/eawpew/) which was calling from a high perch.
Went over a family member's new house and they had a bird feeder off of the patio deck. As we were first getting a tour of the yard, a completely blue bird flew by. It was an [Indigo Bunting](https://ebird.org/species/indbun) which I had been talking to my uncle about wanting to see a few days earlier. It later came back to the bird feeder and it really is a striking bird. I enjoyed pointing out the [Black-capped Chickadee](https://ebird.org/species/bkcchi) and [American Goldfinch](https://ebird.org/species/amegfi) to the little kids.

## Missouri

Went to a wedding, didn't have much downtime but I took a moment to step outside during the reception. At first I didn't see much. There were some [Red-winged Blackbird](https://ebird.org/species/rewbla/) near the pond and a [Northern Cardinal](https://ebird.org/species/norcar/) crossing between stands of trees. I saw some sparrows in the tall, uncut grass, which turned out to be [Field Sparrows](https://ebird.org/species/fiespa/) which I had never seen and an [Eastern Kingbird](https://ebird.org/species/easkin/) in the tree tops. I also saw my second Brown Thrasher a week after I had seen my first miles away in Connecticut.
