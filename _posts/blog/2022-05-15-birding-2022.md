This is a WIP post so I don't have to remember everything next year when I publish this.

## May 13th
Decided to go birding at a Wildlife Sanctuary on a whim. Ended up spending 2.5 hours there and was three new species; [Yellow-breasted Chat](https://ebird.org/species/yebcha), [Ash-throated Flycatcher](https://ebird.org/species/astfly/), and [Clark's Grebe](https://ebird.org/species/clagre/). While I had seen them before, I was really impressed by the [Western Grebes]() I saw which are almost identical to the Clark's, save for slightly more of a dark cap that drops below the eyes. I had previously seen them from a distance, way off shore. But here I saw one probably 20 feet away and I was impressed by its large size, it's majestic black and white plumage, bright red eyes, and the square top of it's head.

I was surprised with how close many of the birds would let me be. One bright blue [Tree Swallow](https://ebird.org/species/treswa/) circled my head 4 times. One bird was too close for my binoculars to focus. Lots of goslings of [Canada Geese](https://ebird.org/species/cangoo)
There were large colonies of Terns and Skimmers; ocean loving birds with narrow wings and big bills. At one point someone (hopefully a researcher) walked out to the [Caspian Tern](https://ebird.org/species/caster1) colony and they all began flying in circles in the air. Over at the next pond, [Black Skimmers](https://ebird.org/species/blkski) collected on a small island. Down by the river a [Forster's Tern](https://ebird.org/species/forter) would hover over the water before diving down for a fish.
In all I saw over 45 species.

## May 14th: Global Big Day
I really leaned into the Big Day this May and spent 5 hours birding and adding up 55 species. I had been hoping to see a [Swinhoe's White-eye](https://ebird.org/species/swiwhe1/) which is typically found in Southeast Asian but has been reported nearby. Identified a [Pacific-slope Flycatcher](https://ebird.org/species/pasfly) for the first time. Spent probably 20 minutes waiting for it to return so I could be sure. Lots of very cute grey fluffballs known as [Bushtit](https://ebird.org/species/bushti) hoping among bushes as a flock looking for bugs. Saw more bright [Yellow Warblers](https://ebird.org/species/yelwar) than I was expecting up in the trees. But I got a great look at a female [Wilson's Warbler](https://ebird.org/species/wlswar) at the end of one of my hikes. They are also almost fully yellow but with a cute, short bill. The herons, especially the [Snowy Egrets](https://ebird.org/species/snoegr) were active in our local seasonal river though they seemed more focused on defending the best fishing spots than actually catching fish.
