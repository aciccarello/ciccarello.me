A couple years ago, I took the W3C "[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/)" training to learn more about how to make websites accessible to more people.
The biggest thing I learned was that there are a wide range of ability levels that people bring to using computers.
A blind person using a screen-reader is a common example people think of when defining accessibility.
But there are lot of different varieties of visual impalements, from different types of color blindness, to partial vision conditions that may make vision blurry or limit field of view.
Then there are physical abilities.
