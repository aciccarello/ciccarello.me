For over a year, I have pulled back from the major social media platforms.
While I still have accounts on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, I've made the choice to avoid them as much as possible.
Initially I was afraid this would disconnect me from important relationships.
I do miss seeing family photos and hearing what coworkers are up to, but I've realized social media sites would rather show me other content.

I decided to log out of all my social media accounts when I realized how much time they were taking from my life.
There is always more content on the internet so even if I had seen all my friend's posts, social media sites would always find new recommendations to add to the feed.
Twitter had gotten particularly bad in this respect, with many posts showing up as "You friend liked this post" or "Popular post from someone someone else follows." 

But Instagram was also changing to be more of a trap.
Stories were becoming the primary way people posted.
The ephemeral content nicely removes the social barriers that prevented people from posting less-than-perfect photos.
But stories are so short-lived that you are required to open the app at least daily to see what your friends were doing.

I realized that I was opening these apps to fill my time.
Any empty moment, or even a busy moment when I was stressed, I would reflexively open these apps.
Even putting time limits on the app didn't break those habbits.
But how often I hit those time limits made me re-think my approach.

So I removed all my social media apps from my phone and logged out from my browsers.
At first it was strange, but then it felt freeing.
I no longer was stressing about the latest news.
I was more alert in social settings.
I began to see how much those feeds were more of a trap than a service.

## Where I'm at today
- Still don't check twitter feeds
- Still don't have Instagram app, though I do check my feed once a day. I've limited my follows drastically.
- Have been using an RSS reader and am considering a paid service with more features
- Have a Mastodon account I check occassionally
- Have been posting from my site with content available via web, email, RSS, and ActivityPub (Mastodon)
- Have realized I check the news too much on my phone. Have strict limit on YouTube as well
