For about 2 year now, I have pulled back from the major social media platforms.
While I still have accounts on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, I've made the choice to avoid them as much as possible.
Initially I was afraid this would disconnect me from important relationships and I definitely have missed many life update posts.
I miss seeing family photos and hearing what coworkers are up to.
However, I've realized social media sites are not great for personal updates and would rather show me other content.

## The Attention Trap

I decided to log out of all my social media accounts when I realized how much time they were taking from my life.
There is always more content on the internet so even if I had seen all my friend's posts, social media sites would add new recommendations to the feed.
Twitter had gotten particularly bad in this respect, with many posts showing up as "You friend liked this post" or "Popular post from someone someone else follows."
I ended up stopping all Facebook notifications because they kept coming up with new categories like "Posts your friend commented on" in a desperate attempt to get me to engage.

Instagram was also changing to be more of a trap.
Stories had become the primary way people posted.
The ephemeral content format nicely removes the social barriers that prevented people from posting less-than-perfect photos.
But stories are so short-lived that require you to open the app at least daily to see what your friends were doing.

I realized that I was opening these apps to fill my time.
Any empty moment, or even a busy moment when I was stressed, I would reflexively open these apps.
Even putting time limits on the app didn't break those habits.
But how often I hit those time limits made me re-think my approach.

So I removed all my social media apps from my phone and logged out from my browsers.
At first it was strange, but then it felt freeing.
I no longer was stressing about the latest news.
I was more alert in social settings.
I began to see how much those feeds were more of a trap than a service.

## Other issues

On top of the attention grabbing concerns,

- Who controls content
- Privacy concerns

## Where I'm at today

So far I haven't felt much temptation to add the old social sites back on my phone.
I tried some workarounds to accessing Instagram and unfollowing most accounts but those caused Meta to lock my account so now I only check it when I get an email notification which is infrequent.
Much of the online content I consume now comes from an RSS reader which uses a long-time web protocol to gather new posts from around the web.
It's refreshing reading posts from other people's blogs or from Mastodon without all the suggested content.
Since Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, a lot of people in the software developer community have moved to Mastodon which was a significant part of [my initial motivation to join Twitter](/blog/2018/01/29/why-i-got-a-twitter-account/).
The [RSS reader I'm currently using](https://www.inoreader.com/) has a generous free plan but I'm considering upgrading to a paid plan.

I do wish I had a way to keep up with more family and friends.
I rely on private group message threads for most updates about immediate family members.
But I also think having a smaller group of people I interact with more intentionally is probably a positive change if I follow through on texting, calling, or visiting people.

I've also noticed a few other ways which I'm still using my phone to kill time.
I've added time limits on apps like YouTube and the news app to limit how much I check my phone during the day.
I turned off Google's "discover" feature which suggests articles and news.
Even my RSS reader app can sometime be a time suck if I'm not careful.
I feel better about having more control over what I'm consuming and there's no longer an endless feed of posts.
But I want to avoid reflexively checking my phone.

The few time's a month I'll open up a site like LinkedIn or Facebook remind me how these platforms are not aligned with my goals.
An endless timeline designed to steal my attention while offering "personalized" content that is anything except personal.
I don't have a problem with anyone else using these services, but right now they are not where I want to be.

## How I share

As a professional web developer, I've enjoyed exploring alternatives to sharing on social media.
My website is now a hub for all sorts of content.
I've implemented an RSS feed and use some external services to share my content via email and on the fediverse/Mastodon so anyone can [subscribe](/subscribe).
It's a bit disconnected from how most people follow, but it's available for anyone who's interested.
Practically, I don't think dropping social media is a viable option for anyone who needs to engage with followers, but I post for myself with little expectation others are reading.

I've also been getting more involved in IndieWeb technologies.
They include a broad range of protocols, tools, and conventions for social sharing on the web.
The solutions aren't perfect and many rely on the generous work of others, but they allow me to interact in similar ways to social media; commenting, liking, and replying to posts; while also maintaining tighter control of the experience.
As my opinion about posting online changes in the future, I can make adjustments to my site to fit what I want the experience to be.
Right now, I'm working on a feature to make it easier to post to the site and I'm in the progress of updating the styles of the pages..
