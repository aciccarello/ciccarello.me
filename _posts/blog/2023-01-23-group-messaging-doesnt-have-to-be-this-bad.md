As one of the few members of my family who doesn't use an iPhone, I frequently get blamed for ruining group messaging.
Photos and videos come through compressed beyond recognition.
Reactions come through as additional texts.
Adding and removing group members results in entirely new threads.

I agree that these issues are a pain.
The reality is that SMS and the later MMS texting standard is extremely limited.
iMessage supports a lot of features natively but it isn't available for all platforms.
But using a third party app isn't ideal either.

It seems like every social group has a different app they prefer.
Yes, many international groups use Whatsapp which is controlled by Meta, but not everyone has that installed.
Some people even actively avoid it.
There are more privacy centered options like Signal and Telegram but those aren't common in my circles.
I've seen organizations where people avoid chat messages entirely and use something like Voxer voice recordings.
My least favorite is Marco Polo which entirely revolves around video messages.

But for years now, there has been a standard that solves almost all of these issues: RCS.
Designed to replace SMS texting, RCS is a modern messaging standard.
It supports sending larger multimedia files including video and voice messages.
There are other modern messaging features like reactions and typing indicators.
Group management is much simpler, with named groups and the ability to edit recipients.

But RCS is not available for everyone.
For a while phone companies were slow to implement the new standard.
Then Google basically gave up on creating an iMessage competitor and threw it's weight behind RCS.
Google built RCS into it's main texting app, and has worked with telcoms and phone providers like Samsung to get broader support.
But there is still one holdout...Apple.

Initially, Apple indicated the standard wasn't ready yet.
It complained about a lack of encryption saying it weakened user's security. But SMS already isn't encrypted so users aren't protected now.
Furthermore, Google has added support for encryption to RCS giving actual protection that Apple could also support.
In short, it looks like Apple is afraid of interoperability that would weaken their iMessage monopoly.

Now, I'm not saying RCS is without it's issues.
The RCS rollout was a slow and painful process.
There are still sometime connections issues and you need to disable it when switching phones.
I also would prefer for Google to be less central of a player in the format.
There is also a risk that RCS will become a target for spam.

Still, for a base messaging platform, every phone should support RCS.
We should be able to send videos. We should be able to react to messages without another text in the thread.
iMessage can still be a separate system and work on its own innovations.
But it should support RCS as the lowest common denominator.
To be absolutely clear, Apple is holding texting back for everyone and they have shown no willingness to fix that.
