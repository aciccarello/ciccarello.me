This year I was able to attend JSConf US 2019 as a representative of SitePen. It was a very fun conference where people showed off the cool things they were building with JavaScript. There was a workshop day where I was able to program a microcontroller running Node. There were also inspiring talks showing how people in the community are affecting positive change both with technological projects and community organizing.

On top of attending the conference, I helped out the [TalkScript](http://talkscript.fm) podcast. On the first day of the conference, we hosted a live lunchtime panel where we had fun discussing some of the stra-man arguments that come up in the JavaScript development community. As the conference continued, the other hosts and I interviewed many of the hosts which we published in a 6-part series.
