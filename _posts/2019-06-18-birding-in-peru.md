When my wife and I arrived in Peru, I didn't know that I would eventually
identify 75 different species in the country. At the time, I was just getting
back into bird watching and had less than 100 species on my lifetime list.
Peru is not known as an eco-tourism hot-spot, perhaps due to the amazing
cultures that have lived in the region, but Peru should be considered for
anyone interested in seeing birds around the world.

### What is so interesting about Peru?

Peru has the [second highest
recorded](https://ebird.org/region/world/regions?yr=cur&hsStats_sortBy=num_species)
variety of bird species, only after Colombia. However, on the citizen science
website ebird, [it is currently listed
20th](https://ebird.org/region/world/regions?yr=cur&changeDate=Set) on the
number of contributed bird count lists. This reflects the gap between what the
country has to offer and the current volume of bird watching interest. The
companion bird guide app to ebird from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology doesn't
have a dedicated download for the birds of Peru. Even after downloading packs
from nearby nations, there is a significant number of birds that are missing
identification information. In contrast, countries like Colombia and most of
Central America have complete packs of all common birds in the country.

What makes Peru so diverse is the range of habitats within its borders. From
the fish rich coasts, to arid lowlands, to the heights of the Andes Mountains,
to the dense jungle of the Amazon, there are so many different ecosystems in a
country about twice the size of Texas. Across these ecosystems you have iconic
birds like [Humboldt penguins](https://ebird.org/species/humpen1), [Andean
condors](https://ebird.org/species/andcon1/L879938), and the national bird:
the Andean cock-of the-rock. While in Peru, we were only able to travel to 4
different regions, however we still saw many different species.

### Lima

We spent most of our time in the southern portion of the city of Lima which
has exploded in size in recent decades. One of the things I loved about Lima
was that despite being densely populated, there are small neighborhood parks
every few blocks. In the park in front of the apartment where we were staying,
I found more than a dozen different species, including [Amazilia
Hummingbirds](https://ebird.org/species/amahum1), [Blue-gray
Tangers](https://ebird.org/species/bugtan),
[Bananaquits](https://ebird.org/species/banana), [Tropical
Kingbirds](https://ebird.org/species/trokin), and both black and red
[Vermilion Flycatchers](https://ebird.org/species/verfly). In some of the
parks with water I found [Black-crowned Night-
Heron](https://ebird.org/species/bcnher) which stand out due to their large
stocky size.

Some birds took a little work to identify. The [Scrub
Blackbird](https://ebird.org/species/scrbla1) was extremely common in our part
of Lima, however it was not well documented so I needed to do some research to
learn how to distinguish it from [Shiny
Cowbirds](https://ebird.org/species/shicow) and the [Blue-black
Grassquit](https://ebird.org/species/blbgra1). Similarly, [Long-tailed
Mockingbirds](https://ebird.org/species/lotmoc1) which are very common were
lacking many example photos. I was able to contribute a few pictures and even
as my first sound recording to help others identify these birds. On May 4th I
contributed to the [Global Big Day](https://ebird.org/news/global-big-day-2019-the-biggest-day-in-birding) as one of 469 people who submitted lists in Peru
to help the country earn the #2 spot for species reported.

I saw several different types of doves while in Lima. The most common was
probably the [West Peruvian Dove](https://ebird.org/species/wepdov1) with a
distinctive blue ring around the eye and flashy white on the wings when it
flew. I had to be careful not to confuse it with the [Eared
Dove](https://ebird.org/species/eardov1) which has a similar shape and size
but is distinguished by large black spots on the wings. There is also a small
[Croaking Ground-Dove](https://ebird.org/species/crgdov1/) which is less than half
the size of the others and has a red striped wing and a bright yellow beak.
Finally, like all modern cities, there were plenty of feral [Rock
Pigeons](https://ebird.org/species/rocpig) in the more urban areas which can
vary from grey, to white, to pink.

The coastline is dominated by huge flocks of black vultures which feed on
garbage while cormorants line up on the streetlights of the beach. I was
surprised by how few gulls I saw on the rocky beaches, but the ones I did see
I had a hard time identifying precisely. On one of the piers I found huge
flocks of one of my new favorite birds, the [Inca
Tern](https://ebird.org/species/incter1) which is slate gray with a few white
stripes. Every once in a while I'd see a large, lonely [Peruvian
Pelican](https://ebird.org/species/perpel1/) flying out a ways from the coast.

### Paracas

In May, we drove down to the national reserve of Paracas about 3 hours south
of Lima. I wasn't sure what to expect other than that people said it was known
for huge numbers of birds. We arrived just in time to catch a boat tour around
the Ballestas Islands. About 30 minutes from the coast we reached the islands
where thousands of cormorants, Peruvian boobies and terns roost. In past
centuries it was exploited for the nutrient rich guano used as fertilizer but
now the islands are a protected area that serves as a tourist attraction.
There indeed were thousands of birds all over the rocks above us as the boat
circled the islands. The majority we saw were [Peruvian
Boobies](https://ebird.org/species/perboo1) which are fun to watch dive into
the water, however there were also large roosts of [Inca
Tern](https://ebird.org/species/incter1). Among these flocks there were also
[Neotropic Cormorants](https://ebird.org/species/neocor), [Peruvian
Pelicans](https://ebird.org/species/perpel1), and a few [Humboldt
Penguins](https://ebird.org/species/humpen1) down at the waterline. Along the
coast of the mainland I also saw [Red-legged
Cormorants](https://ebird.org/species/relcor1), [Guanay
Cormorants](https://ebird.org/species/guacor1) and [Turkey
Vultures](https://ebird.org/species/turvul).

After out boat ride, we drove into the park. Paracas is mostly an empty desert
with course, orange sand. However, the barrenness of the land contrasts the
richness of the waters meaning there were a great variety of shorebirds. My
favorite were [Black Skimmer](https://ebird.org/species/blkski), [Snowy
Plover](https://ebird.org/species/snoplo5), and the iconic [Chilean
Flamingo](https://ebird.org/species/chifla1). Those three were visible from
the viewing area near the park entrance. You are restricted from going all the
way to the coastline to avoid disturbing the birds, however it was exciting to
see the flamingos in person.

### Cañete

After our day in Paracas we spent the week in the region of Cañete about an
hour north but a little inland. The area is dry but irrigated for farming. My
cousin had been describing some of the birds he'd seen so I was excited to see
how many we could find. When we arrived at night we were welcomed by the
nightwatchmen; the small, quiet [Burrowing Owl](https://ebird.org/species/burowl) and the tall, chatty [Peruvian Thick-
knee](https://ebird.org/species/petkne1). The thick-knees are odd birds that call
out at any threats and can be quite loud when gathered in groups.

    objectPosition: "60% center"

Throughout the week my cousin and I kept tabs on the pair of [American
Kestrels](https://ebird.org/species/amekes) that lived nearby. Walking around
the area we were able to identify the [Groove-billed
Ani](https://ebird.org/species/grbani) with it's distinctive thick beak. We
drove to a town further up the valley and saw a [Black-necked
Woodpecker](https://ebird.org/species/blnwoo1) hiding in a dead tree and the
red-faced [Common Gallinule](https://ebird.org/species/comgal1) wandering
around the riverbank. One night I was feeling adventurous, so my cousin and I
went out night birding. I was mostly expecting just to find more burrowing
owls and thick-knees but we ended up stumbling upon a [Tschudi's
Nightjar](https://ebird.org/species/bawnig3https://ebird.org/species/bawnig3)
on the ground 10 feet in front of us. I'd seen nightjars in field guides but
never expected to find one myself, let alone at night, so it was a fun
surprise.

### Cuzco

The most exciting excursion we did in Peru was to fly to the region of Cuzco.
We were there to visit Sacred Valley and see Machu Picchu, but it was also a
fun area for birding. Along our sightseeing tour I saw a few raptors including
more kestrels, [Mountain Caracaras,](https://ebird.org/species/moucar1) and a
[Variable Hawk](https://ebird.org/species/rebhaw2). We briefly stopped at
[Lake Piuray](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L892479) where I saw [Yellow-billed
Teal](https://ebird.org/species/yebtea1) and a few other waterfowl, but our
tour guide was in a hurry to move on. Elsewhere in Sacred Valley there were
dozens of [Rufous-collared Sparrows](https://ebird.org/species/rucspa1), but
at the ruins of Murray I found the brightly colored [Sparkling
Violetear](https://ebird.org/species/spvear1) hummingbird.

Machu Picchu is fairly clear of vegetation and the grass is kept low so it is
mostly inhabited by [Blue-and-white
Swallows](https://ebird.org/species/bawswa1) who I saw nesting in the walls.
The area around Machu Picchu is more forested, so when we hiked down from the
archeological site I logged quite a few firsts including a [White-throated
Quail-Dove](https://ebird.org/species/wtqdov1) and a group of the pheasant-
like [Andean Guans](https://ebird.org/species/andgua1) roosting together in a
tree. It was surprisingly difficult to find birds while hiking down the hill,
however, within the town of Aguas Calientes the birds were easier to find.
From the riverbank I could see a [Torrent
Duck](https://ebird.org/species/torduc1) hanging out on a rock while water
rushed around him. Another riverside find was the [Torrent
Tyrannulet](https://ebird.org/species/tortyr1) which seems like too small of a
flycatcher to be at the water's edge. Up in the trees was a [Slate-throated
Redstart](https://ebird.org/species/sltred) with its mix of primary colors.

The most successful birding of our trip happened on our trip to Lake Humantay
early in the morning through light rain. The lake is about 3 hours from the
city of Cuzco through remote mountains. At the base of the hike is a
campground and stables for pack animals for those who aren't up for a steep
hike 4,200 meters/13,500 feet above sea level. Most of the area was open which
made it easy to spot [Cream-winged
Cinclodes](https://ebird.org/species/crwcin1) and [Plumbeous Sierra-
Finch](https://ebird.org/species/plsfin1), both of which I had to learn while
in the field. One surprise was seeing the large [Andean
Lapwing](https://ebird.org/species/andlap1) shorebird out in the fields among
the horses. My favorite sighting was probably the group [Andean
Flicker](https://ebird.org/species/andfli1)s which called out as we ascended
the final part of the hike. I'd seen [Northern
Flickers](https://ebird.org/species/norfli/) in the US so it was cool to see
the southern variation. As the hike came to an end, a pair of [Mountain
Caracaras](https://ebird.org/species/moucar1) flew low overhead, eventually
meeting up with another pair further down the valley.

I would love to visit Peru again. Next time I'd love to go see some of the
birds of the jungle region, though you have to brave all the bugs that come
with the area. Lake Tripitaka on the far southern border of the country would
also be cool to visit with its collection of waterfowl. There were a few birds
I was hoping to see, specifically the size record holders of the [Andean
Condor](https://ebird.org/species/andcon1/L879938) and the [Giant
Hummingbird](https://ebird.org/species/giahum1/). I didn't pay the \$100 to go
on a tour to see the condors and I knew it was unlikely to see them in the
areas we were but I still held out hope.

It would be great to see Peru expanded as a birding destination. On our way to
Machu Picchu, we met a couple from the US who were into birding but otherwise I
didn't see much interest. But there is a lot of opportunity to expand into
ecotourism. Due to the large volume of tourists that come to the country every
year, it is surprisingly easy to travel, even if you only know English. With
the wide selection of cultural sites to visit, a bird watching tour may not be
high on most people's priorities, but with the number of endemic birds it
would really be a special kind of trip.
