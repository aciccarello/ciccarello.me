This weekend Bekah and I saw a family of Peregrine Falcons on the San Diego shoreline. I've been wanting to see these birds for a long time and we happened to find a whole fam while out on a hike. The adults can reach speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) as they dive to catch birds in midair. [@bekahbugs](https://www.instagram.com/bekahbugs/) even got a short video clip of the three chicks through the binoculars.
