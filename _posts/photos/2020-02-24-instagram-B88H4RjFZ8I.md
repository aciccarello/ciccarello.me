image_alt: "When people hear I like to grow house plants, a lot of people say that they always end up accidentally killing their plants. Well, the truth is that I accidentally kill plants pretty regularly. I've killed succulents, flowers, bonsai trees, lots of attempts at seedlings, and plants I thought were invincible. Even today I realized one of my plants is probably a goner. But plants have a way of surprising you. Adjust how much (or little) water you give it, change how much light it gets, and who knows, it may recover. And even if it doesn't, that pot now has room for a new plant. Trust me, I have lots of pots waiting to hold a new plant, not because I keep failing, but because I'm willing to try again."
