Today, I participated in the [#GlobalBigDay](/posts/tags/GlobalBigDay) birding event. The past year, I've gotten back into bird watching and even gone on guided tours into jungle forests. Even though I stayed in town today, I still managed to find 27 species including this Greater Roadrunner in our neighborhood park. I even identified 2 species of duck for the first time.
During the last few months I have appreciated seeing people dive more into the activities they enjoy and projects they didn't find time to work on before. While I'm still busy with work, today was a fun chance to get outside an enjoy one of my favorite hobbies.
