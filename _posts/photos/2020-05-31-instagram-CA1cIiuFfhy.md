I'm sad today reading up on the latest news on the riots and protests in response to the unjust deaths of black Americans. It saddens me knowing that minority communities have cried out peacefully about their oppression and have been ignored. I'm saddened that a suspicious $20 bill was a death sentenc. I'm sad that police brutality and anti-police sentiment continue to reinforce each other and lead to more blood. I'm sad that communities and small business owners will have to rebuild. I'm upset that people will take advantage of tragedy. I'm sad that people continue to minimize the racial issues America still faces.

I'm hopeful that we may yet make some progress. I'm hopeful that more people are noticing that minority groups are being held back. But change won't come soon enough for those who are currently suffering. Change wont come at all of we don't continue to fight the oppression of others.
