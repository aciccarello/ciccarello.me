It's comforting to know that God won't disown us for having weak faith. If we remain in him he will continue to support us.

Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;  if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;  if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
2 Timothy 2:11‭-‬13 NIV
