Birding should be a place where all feel welcome. As part of [#BlackBirdersWeek](/posts/tags/BlackBirdersWeek) there is a live stream today at 7 PM ET hosted by [@blackafinstem](https://www.instagram.com/blackafinstem/) and [@audubonsociety](https://www.instagram.com/audubonsociety/) discussing [#BirdingWhileBlack](/posts/tags/BirdingWhileBlack). It's a great chance to allow black birders to be seen and to change perceptions about who is part of the birding community.
