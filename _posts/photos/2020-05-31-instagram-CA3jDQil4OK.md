Today kicks off [#BlackBirdersWeek](/posts/tags/BlackBirdersWeek) and day 1 is celebrating people who are [#BlackinNature](/posts/tags/BlackinNature). This event was organized in response to the threats made against Christian Cooper while he was birding in NY. All people should feel safe to enjoy nature.

There are lots of great naturalists, birders, photographers, and scientists of color on Instagram. So checkout these [#BlackinNature](/posts/tags/BlackinNature) accounts.
