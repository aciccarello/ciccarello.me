Four months ago [@bekahbugs](https://www.instagram.com/bekahbugs/) and I visited Rome and made a whirlwind tour of the biggest sights. The art and architecture were breathtaking. There is a mix of modern and historic across the city making it a fun place to travel through.

I've written down some of my memories into a [blog post on my website](http://localhost:8080/blog/2020/02/06/rome-is-a-work-of-art/). There was so much to remember (especially about the Vatican Museums) but I tried to highlight a little about each place we visited. It truly was a special place to see and to meet up with my family.
