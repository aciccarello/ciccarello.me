Happy [#earthday](/posts/tags/earthday)! One of my succulents was overflowing its small pot so I'm trying to propagate it. It's still crazy to me how plants are able to grow with not much more than sun, water, and air. Hopefully our 100°F/38°C temperatures this week aren't too much. The mini ones are inside while they work on roots.
