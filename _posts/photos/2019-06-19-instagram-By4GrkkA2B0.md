While we were in Peru, I had a lot of fun discovering different kinds of birds. By the end of our trip I had seen 75 different species. [@bekahbugs](https://www.instagram.com/bekahbugs/) found it quite comical that we saw "hundreds of Peruvian Boobies" on the Ballestas Islands in Paracas. Who said birding was boring?
