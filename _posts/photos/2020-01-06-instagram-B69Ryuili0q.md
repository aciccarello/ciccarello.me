Happy [#NationalBirdDay](/posts/tags/NationalBirdDay) which highlights the threats that the illegal caged-bird trade and habitat destruction pose to wild birds. 
Try checking out what birds you can see in your own neighborhood. These are some I saw today. Clockwise from the top left red-shouldered hawk, northern cardinal, northern flicker, American crow.
