Brown Pelicans are one of the most striking birds you'll find along the west coast of the US. My favorite thing about them is they will make dramatic dives into the water to catch fish, sometimes multiple birds in a row. They'll also fly together in small flocks neatly lined up floating just above the ocean waves. 
You should check out the cool posts from [#postabird](/posts/tags/postabird) day of [#BlackBirdersWeek](/posts/tags/BlackBirdersWeek). There are lots more interesting bird pictures and facts.
