Happy Mother's Day to my wife. While we may not have kids in our home today, I am so proud of how you stepped into the role of foster mom this past year. Overnight you offered your love and attention to our foster kiddos when they couldn't be with their own mother. You didn't just clothe them, or feed them; you loved them wholeheartedly even knowing we would likely have to say goodbye. Foster parenting can be a weird place to take on the tile of mother but you 100% deserve it. You raise my expectations for who I should be as a father and I'm grateful to stand beside you as we walk through this parenting journey.
