This [#succulent](/posts/tags/succulent) has really thrived in the last month. I had cut off a sizable offshoot recently and both plants have grown since then. Between having a little more space and more regular care while we are home, the mother plant was happy enough to send out a flower stem. I might have to split off another offshoot soon. I'm not sure what variety it is but my research suggests it is some kind of Gasteraloe hybrid.
