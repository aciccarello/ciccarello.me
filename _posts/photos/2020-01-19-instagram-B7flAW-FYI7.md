Today Bekah and I went with her brother, sister-in-law, and their two boys to the Wild Bird Center where volunteers care for injured birds. The boys were so cute running around and checking out the different cages and the large number of ducks on the pond.

Some of the birds we saw (in order of appearance) were Great Horned Owls, American Kestrels, a quail, and a Red Shouldered Hawk.
