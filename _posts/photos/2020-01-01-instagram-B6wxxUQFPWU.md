This year was filled with some great experiences as [@bekahbugs](https://www.instagram.com/bekahbugs/) and I traveled to places I thought I'd never see. Looking ahead I see both light and challenges as we look to navigate our next chapter. But I'm grateful for the loving people around me that have helped me every step of the way. I hope that 2020 brings growth for us all.
