![Section of beach with dozens of jellyfish like creatures where the waves stopped.](/assets/img/2024-valella-beach.jpg){.post-img--float}

Found a ton of these jelly-like creatures called "By-the-wind Sailor" on the beach yesterday.
Apparently each blob is actually a colony of multiple individual creatures that form a floating sail and roam around the ocean.
They are related to the very painful [Portuguese man o' war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_man_o%27_war), though the Velella are relatively benign to humans.
