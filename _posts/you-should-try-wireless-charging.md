Wireless charging has been around for a while now but it's still not ubiquitous. Many people don't know their phone supports the feature. While it's not perfect, I think this is an under-utilized feature of modern cell phones.

# How does it work?

While not necessary, I think it's helpful to know how this technology works. Modern wireless phone chargers uses what is call "Inductive charging". Electricity flowing through a cord produces a small magnetic field. By looping the wire, you can amplify that electric field. You can also reverse the process by producing a magnetic field to cause an electrical current. This technology has been used in electric toothbrushes as well as electric cars.

For phones, there is the Qi wireless charging standard (pronounced *CHEE*) which allows phones from different manufacturers to work on the same chargers. Some phones even support "reverse wireless charging' where the phone can share some of its power with another phone.

# Pros:

It's wireless! No really, your phone charges without being plugged in. This is a surprisingly nice user experience and goes beyond the initial wow factor.

## You can charge when convenient

My favorite part of wireless charging is that starting and stopping charging is as simple as putting down or picking up your phone. Sitting at your desk to work? Drop your phone on the pad so it's charged whenever you get up. Cooking in the kitchen at the end of the day? Leave your phone on the pad in-between text messages without being tied to the one wall with an outlet.

This means it's easier to charge during the day. I have a charger by the bedside and one at my desk

## It works with multiple devices (Android and Apple)

Apple is still holding onto its proprietary lightning connector for iPhones even though most Android have moved to USB-C. However wireless chargers work with both kinds of devices.

## It's built into many phones

Wireless charging is included with most phones made in the last few years. All iPhones from 8 and above, Pixel phones from 3 on (not including the budget 4a/5a), most Samsung Galaxy devices starting at the S6 include wireless charging. Even many budget-friendly phones include a wireless charging receiver in the device. This means you only need a charging pad to get started. If you don't have wireless charging in your phone, you still have the option of adding an external wireless receiver (see below).

## Your port won't wear out as quickly

This is one of the original reasons that I chose wireless charging as a requirement for my current phone. I had gotten tired of my old micro-USB port not working when I would try to charge at night. Because there is almost no physical pressure, there is a lot less wear and tear on your phone with wireless charging.

## You'll be more protected from electrical surges

When traveling internationally, this was a nice added benefit. I don't want to oversate the protection wireless charging brings, you should still use a surge protector if electricity is unstable, but not having a physical connection adds an additional layer of protection to your phone.

## Bonus: You can charge so your battery lasts longer

If you can manage keeping your battery around 50% you can use wireless chargers to keep your battery working for years! (yes it's a little ridiculous but it's on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AF2O4l1JprI))

# Cons:

As keen as I am on this technology, it's important to note that there are a lot of ways this technology isn't perfect.

## Must be aligned to charge

No one wants to wake up in the morning and realize their phone didn't charge, or worse, their alarm didn't go off because their phone died.

## Sometimes a cord is better

Wireless chargers make it easy to keep your phone charged, but if you're down to your last 2% while on a video call, a wireless charger isn't your best option. If you have a battery pack that is thrown in your backpack, you'll also want to use a cord. Unless you (like me) had to add an external receiver to charge your phone, you still can use a cord when it makes sense.

## It doesn't work with some cases and accessories

Wireless charging requires the phone be close to the pad without interference. This means that anything attached to the back could prevent wireless charging from working. This could include magnetic mounts, credit card holders, finger grips, or even a thick case.

## It usually doesn't come in the box

Phones still ship with corded charging as the default. If you want wireless charging, you'll have to shell out extra cash for your own wireless charging pad. Additionally, a power adapter is often not included with a wireless charger.

## Charging is less efficient (and slower)

I hesitate to say this because it's never been a problem for me. Wireless chargers are slower than an equivalent corded charger due to the energy wasted in induction. With wireless chargers, it is easy for me to charge my phone periodically through the day so I typically don't care about speed. However, 7.5 Watt or 10 Watt quick charging is available for most phones (iPhones and Android respectively) with a Quick Charge 3.0 power adapter.

If you're battery is low and you need the fastest charge, use a cord. If your power is coming from a rechargeable battery pack, use a cord. Otherwise, this shouldn't be a problem. 

# Hardware

## Adding wireless charging to a phone without

After having a flaky micro-USB port on my old phone, I decided that wireless charging was a must-have feature for me. The low-end phone I wanted to buy didn't have wireless charging built-in, so I decided to buy an external wireless receiver. These devices are slim, oval-shaped devices with a charging cord coming out. The USB-C device I bought easily it between my phone and the silicone case.

If you are considering this option, you should choose the device that matches your charging connector and that has the appropriate length cord for your device's size. You can usually find one for less than $20. The major downside of an external wireless receiver is that it takes up your charging port so you will need to unplug the receiver to use the port. With a case, this is inconvenient and makes me avoid using portable chargers.

## Wireless charging with a pop-socket

My wife loves having a pop-socket on her phone. Pop-sockets are fairly tall, even when flattened, so they interfere with wireless charging. New pop-sockets are removable, which usually allows you to use a wireless charger. However, if you have to remove a tab to charge wirelessly, it takes a way a lot of the convenience of wireless charging.

Pop-socket sells a solution to the problem they created! A special charger with a cutout for a pop-socket. This actually fixes the alignment issue with wireless charging by making sure your phone is centered on the wireless charger. This does require that your pop-socket be aligned with your phone's wireless charger, but works really well in practice.

## Wireless charging car mounts

For Christmas, I received a wireless charging car mount. This device starts charging my phone whenever I have it in the dock. It's really handy and has worked well. They are a little more expensive than a normal charger, but are a great example of how much easier charging a phone can be.

## Regular Wireless chargers

Two wireless chargers I have tried personally:

* [Anker 10W Wireless Charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KJL4XNY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Yootech 10W Wireless Charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H93NYC5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
