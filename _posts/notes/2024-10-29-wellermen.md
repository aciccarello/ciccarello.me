ðŸŽµ listening to the debut album from <a href="https://www.thewellermen.com/">The Wellermen</a>

This group is known for folk compilations highlighting bass voices.
I think I heard about them in a podcast episode (I can't seem to locate) that had a segement on Sea shanty trend on TikToks.
A bit of a unique niche, but I like hearing what people can do with their voices and digging up obscure songs.
