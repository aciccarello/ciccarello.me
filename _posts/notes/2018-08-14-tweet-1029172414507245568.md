        Overall, it was a fun game considering we were watching the two worst teams in the conference. I wish the tickets weren't so expensive but they were worth it that night.

Tim Howard was great in the goal. Cool to watch such a great player not far from home. [youtu.be/L2aRJEINCfo](https://youtu.be/L2aRJEINCfo)
