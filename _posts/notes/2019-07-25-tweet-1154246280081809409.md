I've been on the new redesign for a while now. Yeah, it feels a little out of place on a desktop but overall I like it. I'm a sucker for change so it always surprises me when people get outraged over redesigns.

I don't see the people hating it explaining why though. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve seen three flavors of criticism about the Twitter redesign:<br>a) I dislike this (no reasons given).<br>b) I dislike this (reasons given).<br>c) How dare you work on this while this other thing is still a problem.<br><br>A is fine is you just want to vent.
