        I've picked up my pace on Duolingo the past few months and have now completed the second level of the Spanish tree. Having had regular exposure to simple sentences has definitely made it easier to learn the language now that we are in Mexico.

Pro tip: If the lessons aren't difficult you can test out of subjects using the ðŸ”‘ icon. It's super helpful for the first few levels since most things are multiple choice.
