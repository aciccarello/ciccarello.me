I know there's an [open issue](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/272) to add documentation but if it's helpful you can look at the [relevant commits](https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/compare/d5f25dec5a441fb4f6783facd54e88de30250c0f...61457954adc86d34a67080313cabf24f11ac4eba) [on my site](https://github.com/aciccarello/ciccarello.me/commit/50a67193255fb81377d77a790b830907469fcc44). The piece missing from the docs is adding a link with a class of "u-url" and an href with your username in the format `acct:anthony@ciccarello.me` to your homepage/h-card.
