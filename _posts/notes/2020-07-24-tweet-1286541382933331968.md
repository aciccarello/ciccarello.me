        The episodes don't seem to have a point. Just two bros traveling while learning some interesting facts about unique situations. I guess they are exposing people to new ideas. But there are very few usable takeaways for such practical topics.

There's a lot of pseudo-science which can be fine if that's the theme of your show. But I really wish it wasn't presented the same as things that have been scientifically researched.
