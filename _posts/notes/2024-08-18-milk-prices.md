Today I learned that both the US and Canada have policies to support dairy farms. The US typically does it by [stabilizing commodity prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_Price_Support_Program) and [subsidizing exports](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/news-releases/2023/usda-announces-additional-assistance-for-dairy-farmers) while [Canada restricts supply with quotas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_and_poultry_supply_management_in_Canada).

That also puts into context why the local Dairy store in Blaine, WA has signs about Canada's $20 customs limit for dairy products. More ice cream for us then...
