        @ethanculp Generally, I think automated tests should be done by developers. I think it helps encourage better developer practices. But I've worked on both kinds of teams, ones with dedicated testers and those where all testing is done by developers and there are pros/cons to both formats.

[@ethanculp](https://twitter.com/ethanculp) Dedicated QA roles tend to do a better job of thinking through edge cases. Without QA you need more of that kind of thinking throughout the development process (requirements/story writing, development, and peer review).
