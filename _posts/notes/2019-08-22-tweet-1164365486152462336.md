        @chiccychiccy @AmericanAir @united I will say they are better than United. But it is disappointing that airlines keep adding unnecessary constraints to customers to save a few bucks.

@chiccychiccy [@AmericanAir](https://twitter.com/AmericanAir) [@united](https://twitter.com/united) So I learned from this experience you have to specifically request to board early to get overhead space.

Don't get me started about boarding groups...
