        The stadium was pretty small (only 25 rows deep) but well filled. There were sections of fans leading chants &amp; cheers as opposed to the normal PA system stuff.

The refs were terrible as was evidenced by the brawl at the end of the game. Slow to call fouls and give cards. Odd fouls at other times. Suspect calls near the [#Rapids96](/posts/tags/Rapids96) goal that completely changed the outcome of game.
