        After 3 hours, @VZWSupport has not been able to fix the issue. Seems like Verizon is locking out unlocked phones. Paired with the spotty service at our house, this is really frustrating. I guess I shouldn't hold my breath for RCS/Chat support ðŸ˜

From Verizon Support: "While the phone will work with many of the basic Verizon network options, enhanced services such as Voice over Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Calling) and LTE Video Calling are not supported."
