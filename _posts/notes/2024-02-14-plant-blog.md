A garden blog where you can post the growth (or decline) of your plants and gardens. Would be really cool to see changes over time. Would also be cool to see more updates about people taking care of their plants and building a culture around that.

We have Instagram accounts for our (vertebrate) pets. But can we do better for the flora?
