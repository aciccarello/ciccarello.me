My favorite part of Apple Music's "Spotify Wrapped" clone is seeing where the app broke and logged 100+ plays on something I only played a few times. Last year was a Charlie Brown Christmas with an honorable mention of 60 plays of The Prince of Egypt. This year was Pixar's Brave score.

I'm guessing it's a bug in their Chromecast integration or possibly albums with various artists. I think the most plays of a song from those albums was 15 so the album stats are an order of magnitude off. And to think this company brought us the iPod. How the mighty have fallen.

If you're curious, [here's what Apple Music thinks my 2023 was like](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/replay-2023/pl.rp-XWWXHB3A4LDj).
