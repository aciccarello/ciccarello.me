I wish there was a setting to hide the text by default. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to get the most out of <a href="https://twitter.com/duolingo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@duolingo</a>? Tip 3: During lessons, first listen to each sentence without looking at the text. Because reading is easier than listening, your brain gets lazy and doesn’t try to listen when it doesn’t have to. Challenge yourself by focusing on listening!</p>&mdash; Bozena Pajak (@BozenaPajak) <a href="https://twitter.com/BozenaPajak/status/1058014523431489537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2018</a></blockquote>
