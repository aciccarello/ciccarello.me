I thought my [#11ty](/posts/tags/11ty/) upgrade had been uneventful.
But then I learned my hacky use of `eleventyExcludeFromCollections` to add reasons for why something was excluded had caused my [draft posts](/drafts/) to suddenly be exposed in my main feed.
I remember reading about that feature but didn't think about the implications.
It's a good thing keeping those drafts hidden isn't important to me.
Hopefully it didn't cause confusion for the 2 people who read my site.
