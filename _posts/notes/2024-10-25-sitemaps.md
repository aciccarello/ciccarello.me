I've noticed a few people recently refer to their top-level pages as "[slash pages](https://slashpages.net/)".
Honestly my first reaction was "Aren't those just 'pages'?", but I've come to find the term kinda fun.

But when people started adding a `/slashes` slash page, I thought "Isn't that a sitemap?".
XML sitemaps are common to aid in search engine indexing, but there are [lots of documented examples](https://indieweb.org/sitemap#Organization_Examples) of human readable sitemaps as well.
Apparently [others think of them as "index pages"](https://chat.indieweb.org/stream/2024-08-02#t1722570031073000).

The fun thing about websites is that people can use whatever URLs they want.
You could even translate those pages into your primary language.
But I'm going to advocate my preference to stick with the traditional `/sitemap` path

So I went ahead and implemented my human readable [/sitemap](/sitemap/){.no-wrap} page.
I limited it to the top-level pages but added an indicator that there are sub-pages.
I also still have my [/sitemap.xml](/sitemap.xml){.no-wrap} file but that's just for the bots.
