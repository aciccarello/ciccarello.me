Found out today that a elderly woman we know from Liberia passed away. She spent most of her life caring for children in Nimba county, many of whom lost family in the country's civil war. Her godly spirit had a profound impact on my wife and me despite being a world away. I'm grateful to have been able to meet her and hope I can live a life half as meaningful has hers. She will be missed.
