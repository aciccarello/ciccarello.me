        I'm not loving the state of private fields in the @tc39 class fields proposal. Adding new syntax and complex semantics for something for private fields doesn't seem worth the value.

I like that private fields are not easy to reach. For use cases where they are needed there are workarounds but I don't think it need to be easy. I'd prefer private symbols as an alternative solution.
