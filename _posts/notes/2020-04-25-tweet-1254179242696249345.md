        I'm concerned that @DrThomasWhite abused his authority when he ignored the voice of the victim, hid risks from the @cedarville community, and over-stated his ability to maintain accountability by hiring *and promoting* a friend who has abused his own authority.

Abuse is hard for the whole community:
- Please listen to victims above abusers.
- Please don't be afraid to seek independent counseling services.
- Please keep leaders accountable for creating cultures that hide abuse.
