I played around with the [Deno](https://deno.land/) JS environment yesterday for the first time in a while and found it surprisingly nice to work with. I liked how integrated everything felt with built in tools like testing and formatting. I also like the idea of the permissions system, though I'm not sure how giving permission works in practice. There are definitely some rough edges getting started but the installation was seamless and I'd consider using it for future projects.
