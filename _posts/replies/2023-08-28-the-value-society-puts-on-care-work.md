As a foster parent, the way people valorized foster care work felt isolating. "You're a saint. I could never do that." It's almost as if by making someone a superhero, that hero's work is considered easier and everyone else feels less responsible. I've wondered if some people in professions like teachers and health care workers have felt the same.
