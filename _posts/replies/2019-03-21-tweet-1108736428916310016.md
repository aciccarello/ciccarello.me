        When I started at Firebase I complained about the state of the docs and now it&#39;s part of my job to programmatically generate the reference docs. There&#39;s a lesson to be learned here, which is that Typedoc should use plain css in its default theme so it&#39;s easier to override

If they were written in SCSS would it be better?
