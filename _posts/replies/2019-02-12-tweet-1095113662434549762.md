        An ethnic group cannot use politics as a means for group success. By nature, political preference and power creates a political system that opposes the protection of property rights. There is no causation and there is likely an inverse causation by politics and success

[@BigJebBos](https://twitter.com/BigJebBos) I'm not sure I follow what you are saying.

I would consider zoning laws and eminent domain political tools that can be used to unequally apply political power. In Denver many believe the political system caters to wealthy developers over long time residents.
