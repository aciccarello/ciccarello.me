        In <a href="https://twitter.com/typescript?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@typescript</a> please don&#39;t use union types to make your objects less type safe. Consider the following: the interface is more flexible, but now any time you talk to talk to obj.items you get errors cause items may be an array, but it might not be an array. <a href="https://t.co/PS9mh6IMSs">pic.twitter.com/PS9mh6IMSs</a>

[@aaronfrost](https://twitter.com/aaronfrost) [@typescript](https://twitter.com/typescript) If I understand you correctly I feel like this falls into "avoid overloading functions". You can make a function easy to use with unions like this but the function becomes more complex because you need to handle both use cases.
