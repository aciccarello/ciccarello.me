      note: I like coffee. I don’t like celery. I’m an Aussie expat living in New York
        City. I know how to spell “onomatopoeia”… and I actually know what it
        means, too.
      locality: New York City

      really… but Americans tend to have the funniest responses) react to eating
      Vegemite for the first time. 😆
