image_alt: Screenshot of a post from Nextdoor with the title 'Need someone to send a Tree of Heaven straight to hell.' and part of the post saying 'The trees are out of control and have gone sentient. They encroach more of our space every day, choking out the plants we actually like. I'm pretty sure they look in my windows at night and watch me shower.'
