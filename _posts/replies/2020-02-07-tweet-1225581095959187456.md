        About 15 times a day, my MacBook Pro completely loses all Internet access. Disabling and re-enabling the WiFi NIC fixes it every time. This problem has survived a clean macOS reinstall.<br><br>Don&#39;t know what to do, because <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AppleSupport</a> will just send it back &quot;could not reproduce&quot;.

[@searls](https://twitter.com/searls) [@AppleSupport](https://twitter.com/AppleSupport) I've had issues with my USB-C hub affecting my wifi. I've read using 5 GHz is less affected but moving my hub to the right side ultimately seemed to fix things.
