        The sass and templates are 2 separate issues. The sass issue is that typedoc-default-theme writes styles in sass but Typedoc brings it in as an npm package, so it only brings in the compiled main.css, so if you want to override it you have to edit compiled css, less user friendly

[@americanwombat](https://twitter.com/americanwombat) Ah, I see. I think forking the template and pointing typedoc to it using the `--theme` option is an easier way to make changes.
