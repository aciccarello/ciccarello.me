    content: Imagine if github had its own IRC server where you couldn't just join
      any random channel, but every repo got its own channel, and that it came
      with a nickserv that just deferred to the usual github third party auth so
      there were no nickname conflicts? With a tab on the repo for jumping into
      public chat? Because that would be infinitely preferable to "where's your
      discord?"

Sounds like what gitter.im tried to be. Linked to GitHub auth and it seemed like the default community for repos for a while. Except it's tied to matrix rather than IRC.
