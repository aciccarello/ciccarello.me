      Human Protocols by Chris

      In summary, the IndieWeb will thrive because of the human protocols we
      develop by using it. We don‚Äôt need a central standards body to define
      those protocols. Instead, we will refine them through continuous
      conversations with ourselves.

      Let‚Äôs keep talking about it üëè I think the next phase of the IndieWeb is
      developing clearer social norms. This is also a great way to engage
      non-technical community members!

      A thought from Jacky:

      But I sorely wish the ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù part of the ‚Äú‚Ä¶

I think Tracey makes some great points here and I'm particularly interested in how to get feedback from readers. I invited a friend of mine to a recent IndieWeb event and they asked the question "what if I'm not interested in posting anything?".

Part of what drew me into posting to my own site was a frustration with the experience on traditional social media sites. I want my site to be a better reading experience than an ad-centered, engagement platform. But I also don't get much feedback from my tiny base of readers. It seems even harder elicit that kind of feedback on a community level. Think about what "reader" representation at IndieWeb events could impact community focus! Maybe we could get more momentum around [Microub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) and building the reading experiences people want.

Like [Jacky mentions](https://jacky.wtf/2024/4/GXB6), I think building more collective tools needs to be part of the solution. But that's a significant responsibility to shoulder and harder still to do it well enough to be user friendly. I love the idea of the [Open Heart Protocol](https://openheart.fyi/) and it's anonymous simplicity. Since I already show webmentions on my site, I would love to figure out a way to seamlessly combine those two data points into one UI.
