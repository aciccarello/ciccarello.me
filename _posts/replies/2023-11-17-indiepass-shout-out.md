      Shout out to @marksuth@mastodon.social for picking up the torch on
      IndiePass and continuing to improve it! The fact that I can post to my own
      bespoke blog from my phone as easily as I can post to Mastodon is a
      testament to the power of the Indieweb and protocols over platforms.
