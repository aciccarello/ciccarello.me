        Canned and frozen vegetables are cheap, so are enriched breads and eggs. Food choice that lessens nutrients is on the people who eat that food. It’s not like Whole Foods is the only store with nutrient food. Chicken and pork are also pretty cheap

[@BigJebBos](https://twitter.com/BigJebBos) Access to grocery stores that stock things like frozen vegetables was a real issue in the communities north of us in Denver. When you have to take several buses to the grocery store, it can be hard to get lots of those foods. Time/supplies to cook can also be an issue.
