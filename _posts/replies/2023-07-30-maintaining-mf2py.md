    content: mf2py, the official Python microformats parser, is now under active
      development. After a hiatus without a lead maintainer, a few community
      members and I have coordinated to help drive the package through a series
      of updates.

Great to hear! Open source work is hard to sustain but I'd love to get more involved in the mf2 node.js tooling. I'll be keeping an eye on the python action to see where things go.
