I hope it goes better this time! I can recommend hopping into [chat](https://indieweb.org/discuss) for humans who can help explain things. You can also try out the experimental [forum](https://indiewebforum.eu/) someone recently set up. If there are parts of the wiki you think should be improved, feedback is welcome.
