Receiving webmentions was easy to set up with [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and [webmention.js](https://mastodon.social/@fromjason/111438328242990548). For a static site, sending webmentions is a little messier, but there is a [netlify plugin](https://github.com/CodeFoodPixels/netlify-plugin-webmentions) that I've found helpful. Always room for improvement though.
