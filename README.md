### Anthony Ciccarello's personal profile website

This repo hosts my personal website on [ciccarello.me](https://www.ciccarello.me).
It also serves as an excuse to push myself and use (or not use) different
technologies. In this case I am implementing a minimal website using
[Material Components for the Web](https://material.io/components/).
Included are some SVG icons from [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline).
The logo fonts I am using are provided by [socicon](http://www.socicon.com/). Simplifying
the tool-set is an intentional exercise to help me think more about the layout and styles I use.

If there is something you would like to see on this site, please open an issue.

To install the project dependencies, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and within the project directory run `npm install`.

To run the build with a local build server use the `npm start` command. If you need debugging output run the following.

```bash
DEBUG=Eleventy* npm start
```
