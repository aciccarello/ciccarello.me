## Sandy Beaches

I'm not the biggest beach bum but here are our favorite places to walk along the sand.

### Ocean Beach Dog Beach

Our favorite dog beach in the county. Wraps around and goes up the river.

### Torrey Pines State Park

Beautiful coastal park and hike to the endangered pine trees that give the park its name.
At low tide, the entire beach is walkable and can be incorporated as part of a hike but make sure not to get stranded by a high tide.
There's also a popular beach at the entrance.
Parking can be limited in the summer.

### Del Mar Dog Beach

### Carlsbad State Beach

Starting at the south end of Carlsbad Village, this long beach lies below the cliffs.
The cliffs have been protected from the ocean with a sea wall and quite nice landscaping.
You can walk on the cement boardwalk below or enjoy the views from the streets above.

To the south, there's also the South Carlsbad State Beach and campground.
The paved campground is at the top of the bluffs overlooking the water.
Though you'll need to reserve months ahead of time to get a spot.

### Carlsbad City Beach

To the north of Carlsbad village there's more beach hidden on the other side of the homes.
Along the street are some gates with stair cases for access.

### Oceanside Harbor Beach

The best beach in Oceanside. Long and wide sand beach with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. Parking can be expensive but there's a free lot on the other side of the railroad tracks if you're willing to walk a ways. This is where I play beach ultimate Tuesday afternoons in the summer.

### Oceanside Pier Beach

Another great beach in North County.
My personal favorite for a walk along the coast or out along the pier.
The sand has washed away as you move further south so you'll want to stick to the north if you want to sit on the beach at high tide.

## Coastal Views

### La Jolla Goldfish Point Trail

A great coastal trail, though I'd recommend doubling back rather than taking the streets back into town.
South of the trail is the main part of town and lots of sea lions and birds along the shore.

### Sunset Cliffs

A perfect place to bring a blanket and watch the sunset (cloud cover permitting). Arrive a little early to find a place to park and a spot to sit.

### Point Loma & Cabrillo National Monument

South of sunset cliffs, Point Loma is a peninsula that has the ocean to the west, and San Diego bay to the east.
Most of the area is controlled by the military and a Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery lines the road before you reach Cabrillo National Monument.
Cabrillo has some of the best views of Coronado Island and you might be able to see a whale or two if you have some binoculars.
We've visited once before but I'd love to come back and hike some of the trails.
Be aware that there is an entrance fee to enter the national monument.

## City Views

### SD Harbor walk

Beautiful views of the San Diego harbor with some cool ships/museums. A bit of a long walk so pick the portion you want to see. Not far from Little Italy.

### Coronado Ferry Landing Park

A great place to view the city. Also has some shops and restaurants.
