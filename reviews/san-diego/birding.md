Also the location of the local Audubon chapter.

Buena Vista Nature Center, Lagoon, & Maxton Park

### Guajome Regional Park

A park with some ponds, nature trails, and campground.
Can get hot in the summer but some of the trails have good tree cover.
Paid parking for the main lot, though there is a small free lot across the street closer to the bike path.

### Whelan Lak Bird Sanctuary

Still on my list of places to go.
It's a former dairy farm that's been turned into a sanctuary.
It's on the north side of Oceanside but only open by appointment or with a monthly opening.

### Libby Lake

A small neighborhood lake, but consistently has an array of waterfowl.

## Bonsall

### Bonsall Preserve

An unassuming park up the San Luis Ray River.
