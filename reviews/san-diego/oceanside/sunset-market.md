A weekly street fair that takes place on Thursdays from 5PM to 9PM.
We mostly come for the food but there are some vendors selling other goods.
There are typically 3 or more musical acts including one big stage in the center of the fair.
A farmer's market is earlier in the day at the same location.
Free parking is usually available in the parking garage just to the south of the market or sometimes in the parking structure at city hall.
There are also some paid lots to the west, across the train tracks and towards the ocean.

## Savory

### Chicken Over Rice

Really tasty mediterranean food.
The meat is marieneted so has lots of flavor.
Then they add multiple toppings and sauces.

### Juanbachi Filipino Hawaiian Japanese Fusion Teppanyaki

I got the Liempo (Filipino BBQ Pork Belly) with Java Rice (Garlic Fried Rice) and it was a rich buttery treat. All the other

### Onigiri House

Japanese food. Like their Chicken Karaage Bowl.

### Turkish Grill

I got a loaded wrap and was really satisfied to the point that I needed to save dessert for later.

### House of Bao

They have steamed buns and dumplings that are really satisfying.
Since most of them are already cooked and in the steamer, you should be able to get your food pretty quickly.

### Happicanes

Tasty juice and boba. I liked their watermelon cane.

Thick cut fries that come hot out of the fryer.
Usually in the northeast corner of Pier View Way and Tremont St.

### Chimi Chimi - Argentine Street Food

A few different variations on grilled meats.
My steak quesadilla was tasty but honestly too greasy.

### Options to Try

These are places I've had my eye on but haven't tried yet.

- Shrimpholic
- Yakisoba Japanese Street Noodle

## Desserts

Most of the desserts at Sunset Market are on the northern fork of the fair past the flower and plant tent.
I like to enjoy our treats at the tables at the end where there's usually some jazz music performance.

### Cannolis

As an east coast Italian, I'm partial to a good cannoli.
This vendor from Boston is a great option.
The cannolis are filled to order and I like to add the chocolate chips.

### Ooey Gooey Cookies

I'm a sucker for a good cookie and somehow they keep these ones warm and soft.
Add in some ice cream and its a perfect treat.

### New Zeland Style Fruit Ice Cream

This is a refreshing ice cream treat.
They essentially blend some fresh fruit into soft serve ice cream.
It was tasty and somewhat unique but I'd prefer some of the other options.

After 6, parking becomes more limited but there are a few options.

- Free parking structure on Seagaze Drive
- Free parking structure behind the library off of Civic Center Drive
- Free street parking on the side streets near Sportfisher Drive
