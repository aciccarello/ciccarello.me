Want to support me?
First, I'm flattered.
Second, I'd love to hear from you.
Third, I liked how [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/support) listed different ways to support so I've listed some ideas from that inspiration.

## Free

If you found something I wrote or worked on beneficial, I always appreciate hearing about it, either via an [email](mailto:anthony@ciccarello.me) or a mention from your own post. ❤️

## Affiliate

Check out my [referrals](/referrals/) page in the off chance there's something you could use.

## Charity

I have a list of organizations on the [foster](/foster/#organizations-accepting-donations) page which would appreciate your support.

## Direct

You can find links to my accounts on a few peer-to-peer payment providers on the [pay](/pay/) page.
