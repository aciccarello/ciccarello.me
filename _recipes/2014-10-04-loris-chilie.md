- Tomato paste (if want it to be thicker)
- Red kidney beans (drained and washed)
- Northern white beans (drained and washed)
- Chile powder
- Oregano
- Green peppers

## Directions

1. Brown the ground beef
1. Add all the ingredients to a slow cooker (heat depending on time)

All cooked in slow cooker
