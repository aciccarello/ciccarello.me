This soup from the [Half Baked Harvest Super Simple Cookbook](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/cookbook/half-baked-harvest-super-simple/) felt like a fancy meal to make and it turned out great. I've included the slow cooker and stovetop directions here but the cookbook also includes [directions for an instant pot](https://seasongenerously.com/2020/02/04/hbh-creamy-chicken-gnocchi-instant-pot-soup/) as well.

## Summary

### Stovetop

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.

3. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, butter, the remaining 1 tablespoon of thyme, and the lemon zest to the mushrooms and cook until garlic is caramelized and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Remove the garlic and mash with a fork and return it to the pot

6. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil
7. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
8. Remove the chicken and shred it using two forks
9. Return the soup to a boil over high heat. Add the gnocchi, grated Parmesan, and milk. Cook, stirring occasionally until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
10. remove and discard the bay leaves and Parmesan rind.
11. Stir the chicken back into the soup.
12. Divide the soup among six bowls and top with thyme and Parmesan.
