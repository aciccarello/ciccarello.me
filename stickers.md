Here's my collection of stickers.
I put most of them on my luggage so some of these show some wear and tear.

### Washington

I also picked up some stickers (and a magnet) at the Wings Over Water birding festival.

My favorites were from [Laurel Mundy](https://www.laurelmundy.com/)
Her artwork is so vivid and beautiful.
I highly recommend checking out her [online store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TinyHouseBigWoods).

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife was also there.
In a small world moment, the biologist there actually knew another biologist friend.
