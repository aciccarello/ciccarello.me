## Other services

Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous people. But why not?

### Eufy

We recently got one of their products for our home. This company has a range of products from Robot vacuums to filtered cat water bowls to security systems. I'm excited about our purchase and like the range of products available. This company is also associated with Anker, which is a brand I like, but be aware that there recently have been some scandals about their video security standards (see news results).

**You get**: Smart home products worth $200+ (nothing extra, $200 is minimum for my referral)

**I get**: A $40 gift card (or other products with multiple referrals)
